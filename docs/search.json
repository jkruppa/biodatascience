    "text": "Welcome\nThis will be a long journey… it’s a hell of a time.\nI need to see it. Therefore, this book is a visualization whenever it is possible or feasible. Some more complex models will be described rather than visualized.\nThere are better mathematical or theoretical books. I would recommend the book by Westfall and Arias (2020)1. It is an enjoyable read and provides a wealth of information on regression models. The visuals are mediocre at best. The R code is outdated and not state of the art for the 21st century.\nSome ideas are not new. I will present them in a different way. I think this is an effective approach to writing a book. The book aims to teach you and enable you to teach statistics to beginners. It may also be beneficial for more advanced classes, but my emphasis was always on the uninformed learners.\nLying to children or some angels will be hurt. Sometimes math is a shield to hide behind. Not really the math itself but the mathematical notations. If you cant speak the math language you cannot follow the train of thought. Because communication the the search for compliance, misunderstanding a language can be barrier.\nMachine room of science\nBloody beginners and the curse of knowledge",

January 2026 at 19:53:56\nIn 2008, Cadiergues and his team won the Ig Nobel Prize at Harvard University in Cambridge for their work with dog and cat fleas1. This book tells the story of what had happened if they won the Nobel Prize in Stockholm instead. The Nobel Prize sparked extensive research in many scientific fields. Fleas became all the rage. Lots of data was collected, fleas were measured, and questions were asked that no one had ever asked before. Let’s check out this data and see what it tells us about fleas. Come along to Adventure Land and get ready to be amazed.\nNone of this happened in our reality. At least not in our branch of reality, if you believe Everett2. But since this book is also about models of reality, we can question the whole of reality and create a new one that fits.\n“Even if I ‘know nothing’, what is the first thing I need to understand?”",

And then one must explain why they look small and cold and seem to move in lockstep around us and do not fall down. Such ideas do not create themselves, nor can they be mechanically derived from anything: they have to be guessed – after which they can be criticized and tested.”1 ##\nWho are these humans, and what is their background? What have they achieved? The science in books loses its humanity. I am in your head, talking to you. You read about the achievements of men who created beautiful things. They had ideas that came out of nowhere. More or less, that’s how it seems. But they were human, and therefore interconnected with other people of their time. Or with the knowledge of their ancestors. I think it’s important to understand these connections in order to gain a better understanding of the theories scientists propose and how they should be judged from our perspective. All humans struggle when doing science. It takes a lot of courage to write down and publish something new. In Figure 3.1, you can see the people that we will cover in the first part of the chapter. We will focus on findings in our solar system. How does everything work behind the curtain of nature? Many people have spent a long time thinking about it and have invented marvellous things like telescopes and advanced mathematics to enlighten humanity.\nFigure 3.1: Dramatis personae in this chapter and their biographical details, as well as important scientific discoveries or hypotheses. Here, we consider scientists who have contributed to research into the celestial bodies in the solar system. The dates refer roughly to the year of publication or when the discovery became known to the public. The arrows illustrate the connection between the findings.",

Here, we consider scientists who have contributed to research into the celestial bodies in the solar system. The dates refer roughly to the year of publication or when the discovery became known to the public. The arrows illustrate the connection between the findings.\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of a selection of celestial bodies in our solar system. All of these bodies can be observed and described using different attributes. The following sections discuss different models of these celestial bodies from previous centuries. First we discuss the hollow earth theory. Second the model of the habital sun. And as third example the deviation of the orbit of Mercury. Most of these models are wrong today, but they still cast shadows.\nFigure 3.3: The hollow Earth model was born from a miscalculation by Newton, which led to Herschel’s theory. (A) Newton had calculated that the Moon was denser than the Earth. It was assumed that the two celestial bodies should have the same density. (B) Halley supposed that the Earth was hollow to make it lighter and achieve the same density ratio.\nFigure 3.4: The habitable sun theory is based on a lot of wrong assumptions about celestrial bodies in the solar system. (A) Observation of sunpots from the earth. (B) Model of the planetary sun. Herschel built the model by applying observations of the Earth standing on the Moon to the Sun.\nFigure 3.5: Deviation in Mercury’s orbit. (A) Observed orbit of Mercury, showing the deviation from the theoretical Newtonian model. (B) Model of the hypothetical planet Vulcan, which solved the deviation by pushing Mercury into the correct orbit.\nFigure 3.6: foo (A) foo (B) foo\nFigure 3.7: Dramatis personae in this chapter and their biographical details, as well as important scientific discoveries or hypotheses.

This sparked a time of increased scientific research on fleas of all types of hosts, with scientists studying them in great detail. A wealth of research questions remained to be addressed, while funding opportunities lay in wait. We now have the great opportunity to use open-source data to revisit all the exciting findings in flea research. What are our main research topics and questions that we want to cover?\nUnfortunately, none of this ever happened in our branch of reality. But it might happen in countless other branches2.\nQuality Rating (ACR): 1-Bad, 2-Poor, 3-Fair, 4-Good, 5-Excellent.\nHow large is the sample size?",

    "text": "6.1 General background\nLast modified on 25. November 2025 at 20:10:00\nBased on standard methods in flea research and experimental entomology, as well as a similar published experiment, the following three types of food for adult cat fleas are possible, representing different nutritional conditions:\nBlood: This is the natural and optimal food source for adult fleas.Often, defibrinated or anticoagulated animal blood (e.g. bovine blood, rabbit blood) is used for this purpose, which is offered in special in vitro feeding systems (e.g. through a membrane).Expectation: Fleas that are optimally nourished should show the greatest jumping distance.\nSugar water: Often serves as a ‘control feed’ or as a feed that provides energy (sugar) but lacks essential nutrients (such as proteins from blood).Expectation: Jumping distance could be reduced due to the lack of blood and thus the proteins important for reproduction, which could impair physiological fitness.\nKetchup - a nutrient-poor or unsuitable food: This option is used to simulate poor, incomplete or stressful nutritional conditions.In a similar documented experiment, ketchup (a combination of sugar, vinegar and minimal other substances, but no blood) was used as the third feed.Expectation: It can be assumed that fleas will show the shortest jumping distance under these conditions, as they lack both essential nutrients and the necessary energy.",

    "text": "8.2 Theoretical background\n\n8.2.1 Fisher’s approach: The ‘significance test’\nFisher saw statistics as a tool for inductive reasoning (learning from data for science).\n\nOnly ONE hypothesis: There is only the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\) e.g., ‘no effect’). An alternative does not formally exist.\nThe measure (p-value): The p-value is a continuous measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).\n\n\\(p = 0.01\\) Strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\\(p = 0.20\\) No evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nThe result: One rejects the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or one does not make a judgement. One never ‘accepts’ the null hypothesis (one simply has not found enough evidence to reject it).\nObjective: Gain knowledge through individual experiments.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Neyman-Pearson’s approach: The ‘hypothesis test’\nNeyman and Pearson sharply criticised Fisher. They said, ‘You can’t reject anything if you don’t know what to accept instead.’ They saw statistics as a decision-making process (behaviourism).\n\nTWO hypotheses: There is the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) AND a specific alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)).\nType 1 and 2 errors: Before the experiment begins, the following is determined:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) (alpha): How often am I allowed to incorrectly find an effect? (e.g. 5%)\n\\(\\beta\\) (Beta): How often am I allowed to mistakenly overlook a real effect? (Power/test strength).\n\nThe result: A tough decision. ‘Accept \\(H_0\\)’ or ‘Reject \\(H_0\\)’ (or Accept \\(H_A\\)).\nGoal: Minimisation of losses over many repeated experiments (as in industrial production).\n\nNeymans philosophy: We are not looking for the ‘truth’ in individual cases, but rather we behave in such a way that we are wrong as rarely as possible in 1000 decisions.\n\n\n8.2.3 Today’s ‘hybrid chaos’\nModern textbooks and software (such as SPSS or R) often use a hybrid that historically makes no sense:\n\nWe define \\(\\alpha = 5\\%\\) (Neyman-Pearson).\nWe calculate an exact p-value (Fisher).\nWe report the p-value as evidence (Fisher), but use it for a hard yes/no decision (Neyman-Pearson).\nWe talk about ‘power’ (Neyman-Pearson), but often only test against a non-specific alternative.\n\nThis mishmash often leads to misunderstandings, such as that a \\(p = 0.001\\) indicates a ‘stronger effect’ than \\(p = 0.049\\) (Fisher thinking), even though in Neyman-Pearson logic at \\(\\alpha = 5\\%\\) , one would have to make exactly the same decision in both cases (‘Reject \\(H_0\\)’).",

More precisely, in parametric statistics, everything is about a line. In a later chapter, we will also explore nonparametric statistical analysis, which is different but somewhat outdated. We have better tools on your shelves to solve problems that were previously solved using nonparametric approaches.\nBefore we go any deeper into statistics, we need to either learn or review some geometry. We need to understand what a line is and how this concept differs in statistics. I will then explain the geometry of a square and the square root. You should be familiar with what both look like in a visualisation. We will revisit such geometries repeatedly. Ultimately, we will bring them together. A line can be expressed as a square. This is a key concept in statistics.",

    "text": "12.2 The hunter and the rabbit\n\n“Statistics is: When the hunter misses the rabbit once to the left and once to the right, on average the rabbit is dead.” — Mike Krüger, German comedian\n\nI first came across the joke on Tweedback, a tool for anonymous feedback in lectures. One student had written the joke, which intrigued me. At first, I could not understand why. Then I understood the deeper meaning. In statistics, it’s all about lines. Or lines through points. A gunshot is a line. A mean is a line. Single shots deviate from the average shot, as do single observations from the mean. If we measure the distance from the mean to each observation, we will get positive and negative values. Ultimately, these values would sum to zero. I don’t believe for a moment that the comedian truly understands the depth of the joke from a statistical perspective.\nIn the following Figure 12.4, I have illustrated the example with some numbers. The rabbit is sitting at position 5m. The hunter shoots at \\(3m\\), which is \\(-2m\\) to the left. The second shot goes to the right, at \\(7m\\), which is a deviation of \\(+2m\\). We can now calculate the average of the two shots. This is equal to \\(5m\\). The hunter hits. When we calculate the deviation, we get zero: \\((-2) + (+2) = 0\\). Therefore, the whole hunt of two shots has no deviation at all. This is wrong. Our model of reality tells us something completely different compared to what our hunter experienced. Therefore, we need a better model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Illustration of the joke about the hunter and the rabbit. If the hunter shoots past the rabbit on the left and on the right, then on average the hunter will hit the rabbit. The deviation is zero. The joke illustrates the problem of measuring a statistical deviation when positive and negative values can occur.",

    "text": "12.1.1 The square and the root\n\n“What you see, well, you might not know; You get the feelin’, comin’ after the glow” — The joker & the thief by Wolfmother\n\nIf you have never studied statistics before, or have only covered the basics, you may be surprised to learn that everything in statistics revolves around squares. However, this is only true for parametric statistics, which is where we want to start. In the following figure on the left side, you can see a square. A square has the same side length \\(a\\) on all sides, as well as a square area \\(a^2\\). If we want to find the side length of a square and only know its area, we can take the square root \\(\\sqrt{\\phantom{a}}\\) shown on the right side. This is a simple geometry, but an important one to remember. We will need to refer to squares repeatedly throughout this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Visualisation of the relationship between a square and its square root. (A) The square consists of two sides of equal length. Therefore, the area of a square is the square of its side. (B) The square root of the area of a square is the length of its side.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s assume that there are lots of squares. Where these squares originate is not currently important. We have these squares and want to summarise them. A standard statistical procedure is to calculate the area of each square and then add up the areas. We call this new square the sum of squares. The sum of the squares is used so often that it is abbreviated to SS.\nThe following figure shows four squares labelled \\(a_1, ..., a_4\\) on the left. Each square has its own area, labelled \\(a_1^2, ..., a_4^2\\). In order to work with these squares, we will now add up their areas. The sum of the squares is shown on the right. The square root describes the length of the side of the sum of squares. We will use the sum of squares and the square root of the sum of squares repeatedly in our further analysis. They may not appear under the same names, but we will see the squares again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Visualisation of the calculation of the sum of squares. (A) The area of each square is determined. (B) All the areas are then combined to form one large square and then called sum of squares. The square root can then be used for further statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this has not been very complicated. You might already remember the geometry from seeing a square. The tricky part is that we will work with mathematical expressions that are essentially squares, but don’t look like them. Now let’s combine a line with a square. Or answer the question of why a line can be expressed by a square.\n\n\n12.1.2 The line as a square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Visualisation of the dependency between a line and a square. (A) A line through two points, also known as a Euclidean line. Most people think of such a line first when they think about lines through points. This is mathematically correct, but not in statistics. (B) The distance between two points, also known as a line, is represented as a square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.3 The hunter and the rabbit\n\n“Statistics is: When the hunter misses the rabbit once to the left and once to the right, on average the rabbit is dead.” — Mike Krüger, German comedian\n\nI first came across the joke on Tweedback, a tool for anonymous feedback in lectures. One student had written the joke, which intrigued me. At first, I could not understand why. Then I understood the deeper meaning. In statistics, it’s all about lines. Or lines through points. A gunshot is a line. A mean is a line. Single shots deviate from the average shot, as do single observations from the mean. If we measure the distance from the mean to each observation, we will get positive and negative values. Ultimately, these values would sum to zero. I don’t believe for a moment that the comedian truly understands the depth of the joke from a statistical perspective.\nIn the following Figure 12.4, I have illustrated the example with some numbers. The rabbit is sitting at position 5m. The hunter shoots at \\(3m\\), which is \\(-2m\\) to the left. The second shot goes to the right, at \\(7m\\), which is a deviation of \\(+2m\\). We can now calculate the average of the two shots. This is equal to \\(5m\\). The hunter hits. When we calculate the deviation, we get zero: \\((-2) + (+2) = 0\\). Therefore, the whole hunt of two shots has no deviation at all. This is wrong. Our model of reality tells us something completely different compared to what our hunter experienced. Therefore, we need a better model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Illustration of the joke about the hunter and the rabbit. If the hunter shoots past the rabbit on the left and on the right, then on average the hunter will hit the rabbit. The deviation is zero. The joke illustrates the problem of measuring a statistical deviation when positive and negative values can occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Visualisation of the deviation from the hunter and rabbit example. (A) Each deviation is squared. Therefore, no sign is left. (B) The deviations are added up. The square root of the sum of squares has the same unit as the original measurement. The example was built in such a way that the root is the standard deviation.",

    "text": "13.1 What is a model in statistics?\nLast modified on 11. January 2026 at 09:07:20\nImagine you are standing on a globe but still believe it is flat. You are standing on solid ground, with boiling rocks a few kilometers below you. A few kilometers above, you cannot breathe anymore. You are not moving, but the Earth is moving at speeds of up to 828,000 km/h, depending on the reference point. Your reality is a serious misinterpretation.\nI would like to start with a simple example of a statistical model. Perhaps you would like to see a more concrete example of a model. But first, I will show you the most general form of a statistical model. The model is simple and contains only two terms combined with a tilde. The following Figure 13.1 shows how the left-hand side and the right-hand side are connected.\nFigure 13.1: Visualisation of a theoretical statistical model with respect to the programming language R, with the outcome shown on the left-hand side (LHS) and the influencer pictured on the right-hand side (RHS). The two terms are combined by a tilde.\nOn the left-hand side (LHS) we find the outcome. The result of an experiment is called the outcome. The outcome is the measured value. Sometimes, using these words can cause you confusion, but for now we’ll stick to the idea that the result of something is measured in an experiment. We will discover the outcome on the y-axis later on. Therefore, we abbreviate the outcome to Y. On the right side (RHS), you will find the influencer. The influencer is the thing we are trying to change in the experiment. If you change the influencer, the statistical model will show you the change in the outcome. As the change will be on the x-axis, we abbreviate the influencer to X. More often than not, we have one outcome and multiple influencers.\nThe world would be much easier, if there would be only one term for the measures y-values and the influencial values on the x-axis. But this is not true. Each scientific field has its own wording and the wording is changing, if you change the algorithm. So it is a real mess. I decided to use the words outcome and influencer for the y-values and x-values throughout the book for the general usage.\ntext\ntext\nA sentence why we use \\(y\\) and not \\(x\\) for mean and other stuff.\n1 What is a statistical model?\n2 What do we mean by a statistical model?\n3 What Is the Purpose of Statistical Modeling?\n4 Where do statistical models come from? Revisiting the problem of specification\n5 Statistical modelling\nFigure 13.2: Visualisation of the causal and predictive model in statistical modelling for a simple model. In all cases, the outcome \\(Y\\) is normally distributed. (A) Explanatory model: How does the outcome y change when the continuous influencer \\(X\\) changes? What is the numerical relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\)? This is a question about the slope of the line. (B) Explanatory model: How does the outcome \\(Y\\) change when the categorical influencer as factor \\(f_A\\) changes? What is the numerical relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(f_A\\)? This is a question about the slope of the line and the difference between the predicted means of each group. (C) Predictive model: If \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) have been measured, what are the values of \\(Y\\) for new \\(X\\) values? Can we use the influencer \\(X\\) to predict new \\(Y\\) outcomes?",

You might pause for a moment and ask yourself: if there is such a thing as classical physics, is there also modern physics? Yes and no. It depends on your perspective. Now, Newton became the benchmark for all new theories and models. Consequently, our observed data became increasingly detailed. We were able to determine the exact orbits of all planets. Everything seems to fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Deviation in Mercury’s orbit. (A) Observed orbit of Mercury, showing the deviation from the theoretical Newtonian model. (B) Model of the hypothetical planet Vulcan, which solved the deviation by pushing Mercury into the correct orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem solved. There was only one small deviation. The orbit of Mercury was slightly off. Specifically, the deviation was 43 arcseconds, or 1.2%, between the observed and calculated orbits using the Newtonian model. Albert Einstein (1879–1955) found this deviation intriguing. His General Theory of Relativity solved this mystery by merging time and space. Before Einstein’s theory was formulated, astronomers suggested the existence of a new planet. They suggested that the deviation would go away if a planet called Vulcan existed and circled the sun in a very narrow orbit. However, this planet was never found.\nAlways remember that models of reality can exist in parallel. Newton’s laws of gravity can be used, even though we know they are wrong and general relativity is less wrong. Why not, right? This is science. We can only reject a model if new observations do not fit into it. Then we must find a new, improved model. However, Newton’s laws are useful in everyday life when we are not moving near the speed of light or relatively to a large mass. In contrast, your GPS only works because we know the General Theory of Relativity. Without this theory, it would not be possible to build and use satellite navigation systems. You can choose your reality and the models you apply.\n\nStill Einstein believed that the solar system was in the middle of the galaxy.

Or, at least, that is what we are supposed to think. Knowledge, once formed, tends to become disembodied from its human origins. That is, while knowledge is preserved in the form of books, formulas, proofs, theorems, and such, we must not forget that before all this the formation of knowledge was the result of human thought, effort, and desire. Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears; our emotions are crucial to its development, and its meaning cannot be truly understood if seen as some bloodless and emotionless enterprise.” — Joshua Schimel in Writing Science4\n\nThere are different types of models. In this book we will mainly talk about statistical models, which are a very specific type of mathematical models. There are other models. There are individual models, like models of control. The way in which we understand and experience reality. There are also scientific theories that can be read as umbrellas above a set of models. Theories and models can be viewed as forming a hierarchical structure. Theories are more general, whereas models are very specific. In everyday language, the terms ‘theory’ and ‘model’ are interchangeable.\nAs scientific workers, we work with models on a daily basis. Therefore, this book is about models. Although we may have a theory in the background, our daily life only sporadically touches such high levels.\nReality can be seen through science by carrying out tiny experiments. These experiments are tiny in the sense that reality is overwhelmingly big, so every experiment is tiny in comparison.\nA model is a snapshot out of a bigger theory. Or to have another picture. A theory is a collage of different models. In each theory different models for a given problem exists. Hence, we can use different models in the Newotonian theory, like the formulas for the motion or gravity. Even if the formual ist wrong and a gravity force does not exists in reality.",

    "text": "3.2 Models of the sun system\nThis chapter tries to tell the story of different men. It also explores their sins. And their misinterpretations of reality. All had brilliant ideas and promoted humanity for the better, and their actions showed great compassion and understanding. History repeats itself, so you can learn a lot from these men. Later in the book, we will focus on fleas and their characteristics. This simple life form is used as a model organism in our search for meaning in statistical models. In this chapter, we look to the stars. Humans stare into the black night and ask many questions about the workings of nature. How do plants move? What are the forces and orbits? It took centuries to answer these questions, with many scientists working without telescopes or modern mathematics. Moreover, modern mathematics was invented as a tool for searching the sky. In the following Figure 3.2, you will see celestial bodies that will be important in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of a selection of celestial bodies in our solar system. All of these bodies can be observed and described using different attributes. The following sections discuss different models of these celestial bodies from previous centuries. First we discuss the hollow earth theory. Second the model of the habital sun. And as third example the deviation of the orbit of Mercury. Most of these models are wrong today, but they still cast shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 The hollow earth\nJohannes Kepler (1571–1630) was born into a world that believed the Earth was at the centre of the universe. The people of his time believed in a geocentric worldview. In 1543, Nikolaus Kopernikus (1473–1543) proposed a heliocentric model of the universe, with the Sun at the center and the Earth orbiting it in a circular path. Nevertheless, the heliocentric worldview was still under debate when Kepler began his work. He studied the data observed by the astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601). Brahe produced detailed observations of planetary movements. He made his observations without the use of a telescope. Brahe was meticulous about the accuracy of his measurements of planetary orbits, and was one of the first people to recognise the importance of making multiple observations. Brahe’s observations of Mars included the collection of all significant data on the planet’s position.\nIt was only on his deathbed that Brahe ordered Kepler to evaluate and publish his data. Kepler complied with this request. Until then, Brahe had rejected many of Kepler’s requests for access to the complete data tables. This is an early example of the importance of open data in research. Kepler found that the positional data for Mars deviated by eight arc minutes from the Copernican circular orbit. This small deviation led Kepler to propose elliptical orbits. Deviation is a key concept in science. To see a deviation and believe that it is a systematic one and not one of pure randomness or measurement error. We will come back to this again and again. Kepler believed in a systematic effect of the deviation and developed the three laws of planetary motion from there. This is also an early example of data acquisition and data science. Brahe produced the data, which Kepler then used data science to interpret.\nYou might now be wondering what an arcminute is. It is a unit of measurement for degrees. Therefore, one degree has 60 arc minutes, and one arc minute has 60 arc seconds. If you look at the full moon, you will see that it covers 32 arc minutes. Kepler therefore believed that the eight-arc-minute deviation in the orbit of Mars was a systematic failure of the 2,000-year-old theory, rather than an error in the measurements taken by its mentor, Tycho Brahe. Nevertheless, it took nearly two centuries of ongoing debate and research for Kepler’s work to take on its final, well-known form.\nFollowing the discovery of elliptical orbits, Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727) formulated the Newtonian theory of gravity. This new theory enabled humanity to calculate gravity on Earth, the Moon’s orbit around Earth, and the movement of the planets around the Sun. This is just one of many applications but not the first one. Edmond Halley (1656–1742) paid for the printing of Newton’s Principia, fascinated by the possibilities of Newton’s findings. Therefore he made one of the first usage of the formulas of Newton. Newton discovered that the Moon had a higher density than the Earth. Halley stated that the Moon and Earth are made of the same material. Therefore, the Earth could only be lighter if the Earth were hollow. However, Halley and Newton based their inaccurate density calculations on Newton’s theory of tides, which describes the movement of water in relation to the Moon’s mass and position. The calculations were wrong because they were based on false assumptions, resulting in an incorrect density ratio of \\(9/5\\) for the Moon and Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The hollow Earth model was born from a miscalculation by Newton, which led to Herschel’s theory. (A) Newton had calculated that the Moon was denser than the Earth. It was assumed that the two celestial bodies should have the same density. (B) Halley supposed that the Earth was hollow to make it lighter and achieve the same density ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there on thinks start to escalate quickly. Halley deeply believed, that the earth is hollow. When 80-year-old Halley was portrayed as Astronomer Royal, he had himself depicted with a diagram of the hollow earth. The model was also used to describe the polar lights that come from the internal sun breaking through the Earth’s crust. Halley later became famous for being fortunate enough to correctly predict the return of Halley’s Comet. At the time, the prediction was considered a significant achievement of Newton’s theory of gravity. However, this success was a one-off, since Newton’s theory of gravity is incorrect, as we will discuss later. The idea of a hollow Earth did not disappear completely. In literature, the most famous public work is the book “Journey to the Centre of the Earth” by Jules Verne. The hollow earth theory lives on in many conspiracy theories to this day.\n\n\n3.2.2 The habitable sun\nOur next example is about using a model with wrong assumptions to generate a theory of the habitable sun. For a modern reader, this sounds like an absolute joke, but in the time of Sir William Herschel (1738-1822), the idea was prominent. First, you must believe that everything has a purpose. Therefore, planets are meant to nurture life. Since there is life on Earth, every planet must have life. In other words, it is a human or anthropocentric world view. The sun is a planet. Why should the Sun be any different? The sun is a planet with luminous clouds. In addition, every planet is solid and has clouds.\nNow, we are standing on Earth and looking at the Sun. What can we see? Small black spots, also known as sunspots. These cannot be observed with the naked eye — this should never be done — but can be seen with a telescope and appropriate filters. So, what are these sunspots? Herschel proposed the following model. Imagine standing on the moon and looking down at the Earth through the clouds. The Earth is a blue planet of water and land. The same is true of the Sun. You can see through the luminous clouds onto the dark surface of the solid sun. In the Figure 3.4, you can see the train of thought of Herschel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The habitable sun theory is based on a lot of wrong assumptions about celestrial bodies in the solar system. (A) Observation of sunpots from the earth. (B) Model of the planetary sun. Herschel built the model by applying observations of the Earth standing on the Moon to the Sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday2\n\n\n3.2.3 The planet Vulcan\nNewton opened up a new field of classical physics. You might pause for a moment and ask yourself: if there is such a thing as classical physics, is there also modern physics? Yes and no. It depends on your perspective. Now, Newton became the benchmark for all new theories and models. Consequently, our observed data became increasingly detailed. We were able to determine the exact orbits of all planets. Everything seems to fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Deviation in Mercury’s orbit. (A) Observed orbit of Mercury, showing the deviation from the theoretical Newtonian model. (B) Model of the hypothetical planet Vulcan, which solved the deviation by pushing Mercury into the correct orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem solved. There was only one small deviation. The orbit of Mercury was slightly off. Specifically, the deviation was 43 arcseconds, or 1.2%, between the observed and calculated orbits using the Newtonian model. Albert Einstein (1879–1955) found this deviation intriguing. His General Theory of Relativity solved this mystery by merging time and space. Before Einstein’s theory was formulated, astronomers suggested the existence of a new planet. They suggested that the deviation would go away if a planet called Vulcan existed and circled the sun in a very narrow orbit. However, this planet was never found.\nAlways remember that models of reality can exist in parallel. Newton’s laws of gravity can be used, even though we know they are wrong and general relativity is less wrong. Why not, right? This is science. We can only reject a model if new observations do not fit into it. Then we must find a new, improved model. However, Newton’s laws are useful in everyday life when we are not moving near the speed of light or relatively to a large mass. In contrast, your GPS only works because we know the General Theory of Relativity. Without this theory, it would not be possible to build and use satellite navigation systems. You can choose your reality and the models you apply.\n\nStill Einstein believed that the solar system was in the middle of the galaxy. And there were no more galaxies than the milky way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: foo (A) foo (B) foo\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the nuclei so small? Considering quantum mechanics, we can only determine exactly the position or the momentum of an object. We see here momentum as speed. Therefore, if we know that the electron is near the nuclei, the speed must be very high. Therefore, the electron can not be very often near the nuclei. Hence, the electron does not fall into it. Due to quantum mechanics, the nuclei has to be so small to have a stable atom.",

    "text": "1.3 What is the opposite of science?\nAs I found out, there is no direct opposite of science. That’s interesting. Sometimes, you can define something by knowing what it is not. You might think this is not so problematic. Take a few minutes to ask yourself: “What is the opposite of science?” Okay, good to have your focus back on the page. Maybe you thought science was cold and rational. I will share my personal story with science. For me, science was Star Trek: Enterprise. But I’m too young for Kirk and Spock. So, I was socialized with Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). That’s where I first encountered Shakespeare, but that’s another story. In TNG, science was determined by the exploration of new worlds. I would sit comfortably on the open bridge in front of the gigantic viewscreen. Commander Data was the embodiment of science. He was an android. He was rational and cold, devoid of emotion and humor. Let’s flip these attributes.\nIf an android is science, then what is a human? Then is the human the opposite of science? Perhaps there is some truth to that. Humans have lived on this planet for thousands of years, but science as we know it began during the Enlightenment. So perhaps humans are the opposite of science. Human beings are full of emotions and feelings. Each one is very subjective and interested in their own development. They feel love and romance. Neither of these is very scientific. Humans also believe. Some believe in a more structured manner, like in big churches, while others believe in a more individual manner. However, believing in something has nothing to do with science. But humans do science. Therefore, science is part of humanity. As Joshua Schimel said, “Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears. Our emotions are crucial to its development, and it cannot be truly understood as some bloodless, emotionless enterprise.”2 Science is a human endeavor.\nAccording to Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”3 Is magic therefore the opposite of science? We cannot perform magic. We do not have the power to do so. However, some humans believe that we can perform magic. Who is “we”? The advanced part of humankind. We come into contact with our brothers and sisters who are at a different technological level, such as tribal cultures on isolated islands in Indonesia. To a tribe with a primitive culture, our technology seems like magic. Here, we can observe the cargo cult. A cargo cult is named after its appearance in World War II. The US Army faced the challenge of determining the best island-hopping route to mainland Japan. Since no one knew and the tides of war were constantly changing, the US Army Logistics Corps decided to drop cargo everywhere. This way, if US soldiers approached an island, there would already be plenty of supplies.\nWhat happened to the indigenous population? They believed that the gods had come to bring them cargo. They could not think of any other explanation for what they observed. They observed hardened silver birds dropping and landing on the islands. After a while, the gods stopped showing up. The war was over. But nobody told them. Therefore, the people of the islands copied the gods’ behavior. They built the control room, and they made a radar station out of grass and wood. They even built plans out of grass. Nothing could work. They did everything perfectly, but they missed the point entirely. It was a cargo cult, not science. They copied someone else’s routine and hoped to experience what the gods experienced when they did the same.\nDo you follow a cargo cult in your daily routines? Do you do things that you have seen but don’t understand? Do you believe that they will work even though you don’t know why? This is totally human and from my point of view totally necessary to be a working community member. Some stuff must be done, even if I don not really understand the why. But what if we do it in science? Then we will do cargo cult science4. It is a danger of enormous proportions if done in the wrong place with the wrong intentions. Still, most intentions are good and are twisted by the circumstances. There are several examples of following dogmatic rules and getting a catastrophic outcome. Later, we will explore different models of reality, including the Fukushima nuclear accident.\nFor now, I would like to conclude that the opposite of science is difficult to grasp. On the one hand, we could argue that human emotions and feelings are the opposite of cold, rational science. However, emotions are also the driving force behind human scientific inquiry. Therefore, we are doing something scientific by leaving the topic open for further research and looking for things that are not science.",

    "text": "1.8 How to do science?\nFrom now on I had to do a harsh decision. Science is broad, this book is in contrast slim. Therefore I will focus on the natural science. Especially, the life science, which includes all living things. Yes, some parts will also applicable to more technical fields like mechanical engineering and engineering sciences but only in a limited way. A building and the humans inside does not accept a error in its structure.\n“As a scientist, you are a professional writer,” Joshua Schimel said.2\nPauli defined the scientific method as “taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.”12. This is more or less about taking a chair and sitting in the middle of the room and getting bored as long as possible. Doing so sparks creativity.\nOtto Kruse stated in his book, “many scientific topics can only be solved once all aspects have been explicitly formulated. The mind is not sufficiently prepared for this, as it can only ever focus on small sections at a time. Systematic thinking is only possible when writing, i.e. recording the results of one’s thinking and relating them to other aspects.”13\nThe two paths of logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: The difference between the two logical pathways: On the left is the inductive logic, which is a bottom-up approach that goes from specific to general. First, we observe and collect data, then we look for patterns in the data. Then, we draw a general conclusion about the pattern. After observing something a few times, we conclude that it is probably a rule. On the right is the deductive logic, a top-down approach from general to specific. We have a general theory and conduct an experiment to test it. Then, we draw a conclusion. From a more common perspective, the two logical pathways have things in common but differ in their train of thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nErst Mach and observational things.\nKarl Pearson what is reality.\nQuantum mechanics, we do not know what reality is.\nThe measurement paradox.

    "text": "1.4 What is not science?\nBesides things that are the opposite of science, there are things that are similar to science or that use attributes and tools in a distorted way to imitate science. Conspiracy theories5,6 look like science and use science terms and tools. They play on a stage that looks like science but has no deeper foundation. It’s more like a nice story about humans harming other humans. However, conspiracy theories attempt to explain the world and often generate money for the storyteller. Therefore, I do not see conspiracy theories as the opposite of science. These conspiracy theories are non-science. Some theories have a historical basis, such as the hollow earth conspiracy theory. We will discuss the origin later. Conspiracy theories like to be retold, and in the process, they grow and multiply. To circumvent the proliferation of conspiracy theories, I will provide an illustration of the anti-conspiracy theory “Birds Aren’t Real” by Peter McIndoe.\nWhat does the movement claim? In short, the US government kills all birds in the US and replaces them with bird-looking drones. Birds sit on power lines to recharge and defecate on cars to mark them visually. The bird drones are there to spy on American citizens. The specifications are inconsistent and vary. This is a typical sign of a conspiracy theory. Finally, U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the government due to his reluctance to kill all the birds as cherry on top.\nWhat do conspiracy theories have in common? They all tell a good story. I personally find them more similar to fairy tales, with the standard Greek dramatic structure of one hero against an anonymous horde of evil. In addition, they all have in common a lack of experiment. They don’t even conduct a small experiment or propose a hypothesis to test. A testable hypothesis is rarely claimed. Even if a hypothesis is present, the story can easily be changed to maintain its purpose: to tell a good story. Here, we will not focus on conspiracy theories and how they work. This topic is beyond the scope of this book.\nThere is another field in which personal stories are the focus. Psychoanalysis uses direct dialogue between two people to help one of them. In psychoanalysis, there are also no experiments. History knows of long debates about whether psychoanalysis is a science or not, or to what extent. Psychoanalysis shares a similar fate to the Humanities in general. They are not considered science in the scope of this book either. Just because something is not a science does not make it bad. Many important things in life have nothing to do with science.",

Scientific models are deductive\nStatistical models are inductive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Inductive reasoning is a probabilistic process in statistics. First, a hypothesis is stated. Then, an experiment is conducted based on the hypothesis, and data is collected. This data is a random representation of observables. This is where the probabilistic process begins. Then, statistical modeling is applied to the experimental data to minimize noise. Finally, a conclusion is drawn. Sometimes the aim is to make a probabilistic decision or explanation, with or without prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inductive reasoning seems a little bit hard to follow. Therefore I made a small experiment, so achieve the formula for the genetic energy of a object focusing on the velocity. We will keep the mass constant to make things easier. The formula is well known science Newton found them. The formula for the kinetic energy is \\(E_[kinetic] = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\). Therefore we take the mass of a object in kilogram and multiply it by the quadratic velocity. The velocity is defined by the following \\(v = \\tfrac{d}{t}\\). We divide the traveled distance by the needed time of the object. Now I want to find the dependency between the velocity and the kinetic energy. Therefore I build the following apparatus. A ball with a mass of \\(30g\\) or \\(0.03kg\\) lies on a height adjustable tower. The ball will travel without friction a ramp with a distance of \\(60cm\\) or \\(0.6m\\) to the ground. We will measure at different heights how long the ball will take to reach the ground. In each trail we can than calculate the velocity. We know the energy of the ball on the top. There we find the potential energy \\(E[potential] = mgh\\). We multiply the mass of the ball with the earth acceleration of \\(9.81\\tfrac{m}{s^2}\\) and the height of the tower. Because we change the height, we also increase the energy of the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The formula for kinetic energy can be derived through the following example experiment. A ball of fixed mass rolls down a fixed ramp from different heights. For each trial, the time it takes the ball to reach the bottom is measured with a stopwatch. The velocity can be calculated from the traveled distance and time. As the height increases, the ball will reach the ground in less time. Friction can be ignored. However, a measurement error will most likely occur in each trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet write everything together. We have the mass of the ball \\(m = 0.03kg\\) and the length of the ramp \\(d = 2m\\) as well as the earth acceleration \\(g = 9.81 m/s^2\\). Now we put the tower at five heights and let the ball roll. Surprisingly fast runs the ball. Because we can not perfectly adjust the height and the manual time measurement is error prone we get noisy measures of the velocity. We observe data and observed data has an error. The table Table 1.1 includes the measured and calculated data.\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Results table from the experiment to determine the formula for kinetic energy. The height was changed five times.

Therefore, I conducted a small experiment to derive the formula for an object’s genetic energy, focusing on velocity. To make things easier, we will keep the mass constant. The formula is well-known; Newton discovered it. The formula for kinetic energy is \\(E_{kinetic} = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\). Therefore, we will take the mass of an object in kilograms and multiply it by the square of the velocity. Velocity is defined as follows: \\(v = \\tfrac{d}{t}\\). We divide the distance traveled by the time it takes the object to travel that distance. Now, I want to find the dependency between velocity and kinetic energy. To do so, I built the following apparatus. A \\(30\\)-gram (\\(0.03kg\\)) ball lies on a height-adjustable tower. The ball will travel a ramp without friction, covering a distance of \\(60cm\\) (\\(0.6m\\)) to the ground. At different heights, we will measure how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. Then, we can calculate the velocity in each trial. We know the ball’s energy at the top. At the top, we find the potential energy with \\(E_{potential} = mgh\\). We will multiply the ball’s mass by the acceleration due to gravity, which is \\(9.81 m/s^2\\), and the height of the tower. Since we are changing the height, the ball’s energy will also increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: The formula for kinetic energy can be derived through the following example experiment. A ball of fixed mass rolls down a fixed ramp from different heights. For each trial, the time it takes the ball to reach the bottom is measured with a stopwatch. The velocity can be calculated from the traveled distance and time. As the height increases, the ball will reach the ground in less time. Friction can be ignored. However, a measurement error will most likely occur in each trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s write everything down. We have the mass of the ball, \\(m = 0.03kg\\), the length of the ramp, \\(d = 2m\\), and the acceleration due to gravity, \\(g = 9.81 m/s^2\\). We put the tower at five different heights and let the ball roll. The ball runs surprisingly fast.

Therefore, we will visualize our data throughout the book. The Figure 1.9 displays the five data points for the energy of the balls and the final velocity. The blue line shows the result of a statistical model. I ran a nonlinear regression to find the perfect line through the points. How did I do this? We will discuss modeling later in the book. In contrast, the purple line shows the actual dependency of velocity on energy. There is a deviation in our statistical model. We can visualize this deviation as an area of uncertainty in our plot. Due to this deviation, we cannot find the perfect formula. There are different ways to show statistical deviation. In general, the deviation is related to how far the individual observations or points are from the line drawn by the model. This process is called fitting a line through points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Visualization of the relationship between energy and velocity.

Not really the errors themselves, but rather the concept of drawing lines through points by minimizing error.\n\n\nRandomization and random observations",

    "text": "1.5 What is science?\nI have discussed what the opposite of science could be. We have thought about what science not to meant. Know I want to make a little bit more clear, what science supposedly is. We divide science into two parts. The natural sciences, which include beside others physics, chemistry and biology. With biology we include all the life sciences. The other part is the formal science. We see here the formal science as tools to do science. As formal science we have as the main fields the mathematics, logic and theoretical computer science.\nExperimentation and falsification lie at the core of science. We cannot reject an experiment. An experiment either takes place or it does not. However, a testable hypothesis can be rejected. This is sometimes referred to as the demarcation line of science, which is used to determine whether a field belongs to the natural sciences. In this book, we will use formal science to study the natural sciences. We need formal science as a tool.\nMeters of books have been written about the sciences. As at the beginning stated, there are different version and definitions. While I was writing what you are now reading, I found some literature I party read and find intriguing. We meet Karl Pearson again as a founder of statistics, but in 1892 he wrote the book “The grammar of science”7, which also inspired Einstein on his way to relativity.\nCan science be objective? “Science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind. […] In truth, the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.”\n“The classification of facts, the recognition of their sequence and relative significance is the function of science, and the habit of forming a judgment upon these facts unbiased by personal feeling is characteristic of what may be termed the scientific frame of mind.” Karl\nErsnt Mach (1838-1916) “Ernst Mach’s positivism is a subjective, anti-metaphysical philosophy of science that restricts legitimate knowledge exclusively to directly observable sensations and measurements. He rejected unobservable entities like atoms as”hypothetical fictions”,”\n8 What is this thing called Science?\n“In the same way, it is possible to follow form and call it science, but that is pseudo-science.”\n“It should not be”science has shown” but “this experiment, this effect, has shown.”\n“the result of the discovery that it is worthwhile rechecking by new direct experience, and not necessarily trusting the [human] race[’s] experience from the past.”\n9 What is science\n10 What is science?\nDavid Deutsch claimed that science is guessing and falsification. Or in his words, “Tte whole [scientific] process resembles biological evolution. A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche.”11\nWe conclude the following: A hypothesis should be testable through experimentation. The experiment should be designed in such a way that the hypothesis can be rejected. We need falsification. The experiment should also be reproducible; we will come to this point later.",

    "section": "1.2 Old start",
    "text": "1.2 Old start\nThe first chapter of this book is already the hardest. I started writing this chapter very early on, perhaps even before any of the others. Yet it took the longest to finish. The question is simple: What is science? The more I researched, the more complicated the answer became. Or the other way around. I followed the advice of Wolfgang Pauli. Pauli defined the scientific method as “taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.” Therefore, I tried to read and find answers to the question of what science might be. Perhaps science is, at its core, something personal. However, science also has objective aspects that I want to present here. Ultimately, decide for yourself what science truly is.\nThe following Figure 1.2 shows the demarcation line between science and non-science. In the next sections, we will discuss each specific part, but I think it’s important to start with a clear overview. Science is distinguished from non-science through experimentation and falsification. This is true in this book. There are many subtle definitions, but I will keep it simple here. If an experiment is not possible, then it is not science. We also need the ability to build a falsification framework. Therefore, we need hypotheses that can be rejected by experimentation. These two requirements are met by the natural sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology, in order of their purity. Biology includes medicine and all other fields of knowledge gathered from living things. In addition to natural science, there is formal science, which can be seen as a tool of science. This is due to the lack of experimentation, falsification, or both. Therefore, we will not include mathematics, logic, or theoretical computer science as sciences. True non-science fields are intuition-based or subjective at their core. There are many of these fields, and we will discuss them shortly. The humanities are undoubtedly different from non-science, but this book is not about the humanities, so we will put them aside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Visualization of the demarcation line of science. This line divides science from non-science through experimentation and the principle of falsification. The purity of science fields is taken from xkcd comic #435 (https://xkcd.com/435). According to this definition, natural science, including physics, chemistry, and biology, is separated from formal science, including mathematics. Formal science must be clearly distinguished from other intuition-based and subjective non-science, such as pseudoscience or anti-science. The humanities are indisputably different but are also considered non-science in this schematic.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps we should start with the supposedly easy part. What is the opposite of science? In doing so, we will gain an understanding of the term “science” and what it means to us. This may be the deepest lesson for me: we cannot really grasp science. Science is connected to each person in a different emotional way. Science seems cold and rational, but humans are not. Therefore, our relationship with science is strange and complex. Science is its own way of thinking, perhaps a philosophy. Therefore, there are as many ways of thinking as there are human minds.",
