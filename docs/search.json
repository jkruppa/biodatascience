November 2025 at 19:08:33\nIn 2008, Cadiergues and his team won the Ig Nobel Prize at Harvard University in Cambridge for their work with dog and cat fleas1. This book tells the story of what had happened if they won the Nobel Prize in Stockholm instead. The Nobel Prize sparked extensive research in many scientific fields. Fleas became all the rage. Lots of data was collected, fleas were measured, and questions were asked that no one had ever asked before. Let’s check out this data and see what it tells us about fleas. Come along to Adventure Land and get ready to be amazed.\nNone of this happened in our reality. At least not in our branch of reality, if you believe Everett2. But since this book is also about models of reality, we can question the whole of reality and create a new one that fits.",

This sparked a time of increased scientific research on fleas of all types of hosts, with scientists studying them in great detail. A wealth of research questions remained to be addressed, while funding opportunities lay in wait. We now have the great opportunity to use open-source data to revisit all the exciting findings in flea research. What are our main research topics and questions that we want to cover?\nUnfortunately, none of this ever happened in our branch of reality. But it might happen in countless other branches2.",

    "text": "6.1 General background\nLast modified on 25. November 2025 at 20:10:00\nBased on standard methods in flea research and experimental entomology, as well as a similar published experiment, the following three types of food for adult cat fleas are possible, representing different nutritional conditions:\nBlood: This is the natural and optimal food source for adult fleas.Often, defibrinated or anticoagulated animal blood (e.g. bovine blood, rabbit blood) is used for this purpose, which is offered in special in vitro feeding systems (e.g. through a membrane).Expectation: Fleas that are optimally nourished should show the greatest jumping distance.\nSugar water: Often serves as a ‘control feed’ or as a feed that provides energy (sugar) but lacks essential nutrients (such as proteins from blood).Expectation: Jumping distance could be reduced due to the lack of blood and thus the proteins important for reproduction, which could impair physiological fitness.\nKetchup - a nutrient-poor or unsuitable food: This option is used to simulate poor, incomplete or stressful nutritional conditions.In a similar documented experiment, ketchup (a combination of sugar, vinegar and minimal other substances, but no blood) was used as the third feed.Expectation: It can be assumed that fleas will show the shortest jumping distance under these conditions, as they lack both essential nutrients and the necessary energy.",

    "text": "8.2 Theoretical background\n\n8.2.1 Fisher’s approach: The ‘significance test’\nFisher saw statistics as a tool for inductive reasoning (learning from data for science).\n\nOnly ONE hypothesis: There is only the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\) e.g., ‘no effect’). An alternative does not formally exist.\nThe measure (p-value): The p-value is a continuous measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).\n\n\\(p = 0.01\\) Strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\\(p = 0.20\\) No evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nThe result: One rejects the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or one does not make a judgement. One never ‘accepts’ the null hypothesis (one simply has not found enough evidence to reject it).\nObjective: Gain knowledge through individual experiments.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Neyman-Pearson’s approach: The ‘hypothesis test’\nNeyman and Pearson sharply criticised Fisher. They said, ‘You can’t reject anything if you don’t know what to accept instead.’ They saw statistics as a decision-making process (behaviourism).\n\nTWO hypotheses: There is the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) AND a specific alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)).\nType 1 and 2 errors: Before the experiment begins, the following is determined:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) (alpha): How often am I allowed to incorrectly find an effect? (e.g. 5%)\n\\(\\beta\\) (Beta): How often am I allowed to mistakenly overlook a real effect? (Power/test strength).\n\nThe result: A tough decision. ‘Accept \\(H_0\\)’ or ‘Reject \\(H_0\\)’ (or Accept \\(H_A\\)).\nGoal: Minimisation of losses over many repeated experiments (as in industrial production).\n\nNeymans philosophy: We are not looking for the ‘truth’ in individual cases, but rather we behave in such a way that we are wrong as rarely as possible in 1000 decisions.\n\n\n8.2.3 Today’s ‘hybrid chaos’\nModern textbooks and software (such as SPSS or R) often use a hybrid that historically makes no sense:\n\nWe define \\(\\alpha = 5\\%\\) (Neyman-Pearson).\nWe calculate an exact p-value (Fisher).\nWe report the p-value as evidence (Fisher), but use it for a hard yes/no decision (Neyman-Pearson).\nWe talk about ‘power’ (Neyman-Pearson), but often only test against a non-specific alternative.\n\nThis mishmash often leads to misunderstandings, such as that a \\(p = 0.001\\) indicates a ‘stronger effect’ than \\(p = 0.049\\) (Fisher thinking), even though in Neyman-Pearson logic at \\(\\alpha = 5\\%\\) , one would have to make exactly the same decision in both cases (‘Reject \\(H_0\\)’).",
