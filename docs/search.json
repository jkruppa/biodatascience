She was alone in the light.\nThe light traveled in a straight line through floating particles in the air. Squares of light slowly turn and dance. They are trying to find the optimal position and size.\nThe stage is set. She takes a step. Then another. She feels the creak of the moist wooden stage. She turned her head toward the seats.\nHer voice was crystal clear in the cold air. “I don’t think this will work, Jeff! The whole stage is rotten. There’s no structure behind it.”\nDarkness again. The light bleeds out. She felt alone in the dark. From below, Jeff asked in disbelief, “What are you doing? Fixing the stage? Can we continue then? I’ll try to help you, but I don’t understand why.”\nEmma was an actress, not a craftsman. “I have been doing this for a long time. I need to understand the stage and how everything works. It’s important for us.”\nA long pause of silence. “The reality of the play,” Jeff grumbled and sank into his seat. They won’t be able to start for a long time.\nThis will be a long journey… it’s a hell of a time.\nI need to see it. Therefore, this book is a visualization whenever it is possible or feasible. Some more complex models will be described rather than visualized.\nThere are better mathematical or theoretical books. I would recommend the book by Westfall and Arias (2020)1. It is an enjoyable read and provides a wealth of information on regression models. The visuals are mediocre at best. The R code is outdated and not state of the art for the 21st century.\nSome ideas are not new. I will present them in a different way. I think this is an effective approach to writing a book. The book aims to teach you and enable you to teach statistics to beginners. It may also be beneficial for more advanced classes, but my emphasis was always on the uninformed learners.\nLying to children or some angels will be hurt. Sometimes math is a shield to hide behind. Not really the math itself but the mathematical notations. If you cant speak the math language you cannot follow the train of thought. Because communication the the search for compliance, misunderstanding a language can be barrier.\nMachine room of science\nBloody beginners and the curse of knowledge",

She saw the shadows of set pieces looming in the darkness. Even though she was standing, she felt a slight movement. Were the seats reddish or gray? Was everything old? Old as the universe itself?\n“Jeff, what are we playing? What’s the drama about?” Emma asked the empty seats.\nBelow her, deep out of the darkness, came Jeff’s voice. “It depends on your perspective. What do you want to play? What do you want to discover? What are your beliefs?” Jeff exhaled wearily and sat down on a seat to her right. She could not see him.\n“Can we start and see what comes to mind? Let’s make the best of it.”\n“You know nothing, Emma.” Jeff changed his position again.\nIn 2008, Cadiergues and his team won the Ig Nobel Prize at Harvard University in Cambridge for their work with dog and cat fleas1.

    "text": "1.1 Philosophies of science\nLast modified on 12. February 2026 at 08:21:05\nThe stage. The stage was where everything was happening. Emma had been an actor for as long as she could remember. Still, the mechanics of the stage or even its purpose never crossed her mind. Something was rotten beneath her feet, though. She could feel Jeff’s eyes on her. He was sitting somewhere in the dark, waiting for her to start. However, she could not start playing until she understood the stage. The structure. The why. Emma started looking around in the darkness, using each flickering light to gather information about her surroundings.\n“Jeff, how old is this stage where I’m supposed to play?” She asked, walking and looking around.\n“Hundreds of years, I suppose. Why is it important to you? You’ve been playing the game for years, and I think you will continue to do so for many more years. The stage doesn’t matter if you do a good job. Just perform the play. What does it matter how the stage is build, the light works, or where the music comes from?” Jeff answered sharply, only moving slightly in his red chair.\n“Sometimes I don’t like you, Jeff.”\n“How can you dislike someone you can’t even observe?”\nEmma ignored Jeff for a moment and mumbled, “Something has changed. Something is different. By understanding the stage, I will become a better actor. My work will be more influential and richer.” Emma starts to look behind the stage curtains.\nJeff grumbles. “You won’t like what you see…” But Emma had gone too far.\n“Anything goes” is Paul Feyerabend’s famous dictum1. Therefore, you can stop here. If you are not interested in the historical or philosophical background of what we call science, then skip ahead to the next chapter. You don’t really need the background. Or, to say it in the words of David Mermin, “Shut up and calculate!”2 With this statement, Mermin describes the Copenhagen interpretation as a philosophy of quantum physics that prioritizes mathematical results over foundational philosophical questions. Even if you don’t have a theoretical background, you can work on knowledge generation and new devices. Therefore, if your time is limited, go on, brave seeker after truth.\nFor everyone else, I have written this introduction chapter. Maybe you’re puzzled about what this science thing is all about. That’s perfectly normal. Today, education strips away the historical and philosophical context and jumps directly into biological, chemical, or physical topics. History tells the story of countries and people, not the combination of history and the natural sciences. There is so much to learn. Therefore, there is seldom room for philosophy in any rushed school schedule. However, humans do science. What humans do becomes history. The reasons and ways in which humans do things are strongly connected to their thoughts and beliefs. Therefore, they have a philosophy, even if they are not aware of it. So, if you do science, you do so with a particular way of thinking. Perhaps science is, at its core, something personal. However, science also has objective aspects that I want to present here. Therefore, you have a philosophy, whether you are aware of it or not. It’s time to talk about it a little bit. Ultimately, decide for yourself what science truly is.\nWhat could possibly be a better argument for something than the thought of a genius and Nobel Prize winner? Therefore, we begin this section with a quote from Albert Einstein.\nDon’t worry, we won’t start with the science of the Stone Age. Instead, we will focus on the modern era and the knowledge gathered during this time. In this section, we will also focus on science itself. We will discuss data and models later. For now, we will focus solely on the meaning of science. Science is hard to pinpoint. I thought it would be easy to define. What could be the problem? Then I thought about it, read about it, and thought about it again. There are three big books. The fact that there are four big books alone shows you that it cannot be so easy to define science. Yes, it is complicated. In the end, I will give you all the sources, but for now, there are four books: The Logic of Scientific Discovery by Karl Popper3, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn4, The beginning of infinity: Explanations that transform the world by David Deutsch5 and Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge by Paul Karl Feyerabend1. You can read these books or not. I will give you a brief introduction and refer to them. As always, a brief summary cannot encompass all the ideas of these books.\nBefore we continue, I would like to present a brief example of knowledge generation. How can we obtain enterprise knowledge? We will explore the appealing ideas and concepts from the beginning of the last century. In our case, we will explore cholera as a human curse through the lens of a renowned German scientist and his theories. In science, everything starts with an observation. As Isaac Asimov said, “In science, everything new begins with someone muttering: ‘Hmm, that’s strange!’”\nNow, we will learn about the philosophy of science. We will use Pettenkofer as an example. We will meet other people with strange ideas later on. Strange ideas are also science. It’s thinking outside the box. From a philosophical point of view, who was Pettenkofer? He was a positivist. This is a specific philosophical approach to acquiring knowledge. Positivists only believe in what can be seen or observed. If you wear glasses, you may notice a slight flaw in the argument about what is and isn’t observable while reading this book.\nBefore explaining different philosophies in science, we will take a brief detour into logical reasoning. Logic is necessary from time to time, so we will first cover the basics of inductive and deductive reasoning.",

    "text": "“I fully agree with you about the significance and educational value of as well as history and philosophy of science. So many people today - and even professional - seem to me like someone who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is - in my opinion - the mark of distinction between a mere craftsman or specialist and a real seeker after truth.” — Albert Einstein\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Observing cholera and breathing walls\nIn 1854, cholera visited the city of Munich in Bavaria, Germany. This was not a pleasant visit, as many citizens died of cholera and its consequences. However, not all parts of the city were affected equally. By the end of the 19th century, Munich would become one of the cleanest cities in Europe. Max von Pettenkofer achieved this by building and renovating the canalization system. When cholera arrived, not all parts of the city had equal access to the canalization and fresh water supply. Some parts of the city had easy access to fresh water and working toilets. In other parts of the city, sometimes only divided by a street, construction of the canalization had not yet begun. It was observed that the death toll from cholera varied by district.\nIn the following Figure 1.1 (A) we see a fictional pattern. It is of two districts of Munich. On the left, the sewerage and freshwater systems are already installed and operational. We can call this area the “hygienic area.” On the right, the canalization has not been finished or even started. We will call this area “filthy” or “dirty.” After the cholera epidemic outbreak, the number of deaths in each district was counted. There were ten deaths in the hygienic area and twenty-nine in the filthy area. We assume that both areas have roughly the same number of inhabitants.\nPettenkofer observed the lower death rates in hygienic areas and concluded that canals and fresh water would stop cholera from spreading and killing people. Therefore, more sewage systems must be installed, and the city must be cleaned up. But wait a minute. What is the cause of the deaths? Yes, it is the illness cholera. But how does it work? What causes the illness? Pettenkofer discovered a way to cure or prevent cholera, even though he did not understand the cause of the illness. He did not know how it was transmitted or why people died from it. He proposed that the cause should be found in specific soil and groundwater processes.\nIn 1883, Robert Koch discovered the cholera bacillus to be the cause of the illness. Pettenkofer did not believe in unobservable bacteria. In 1892, at a cholera conference, his belief was so strong that he drank a cholera culture. He survived with mild symptoms. According to Pettenkofer, the cholera culture could not be the reason people died. He was still alive.\nAnother example of Pettenkofer’s thinking is the breathing wall. Figure 1.1 (B) shows the experimental setup. Pettenkofer sealed off his office. He sealed the doors and windows with glue. From his point of view, the room was perfectly contained. Then, he measured the airflow inside the room. The room’s pressure stayed constant while an influx could be measured. Therefore, Pettenkofer concluded that air could pass through the walls’ pores. Thus, the breathing wall model was born. However, it has been suggested that Pettenkofer might have forgotten to seal a chimney, or that the wooden floor and ceiling might have been leaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Visualization of two erroneous theories by Max von Pettenkofer (1818–1901). As a positivist, he only believed in facts that he could see, like the results of experiments. (A) Schematic example of the influence of soil conditions, here represented as fresh water/sewage (blue), on cholera cases. The district with a fresh water supply has fewer cholera cases than the district without access. Pettenkofer was able to contain cholera through hygiene, even if he could not determine its cause. (B) The breathing wall concept, which states that the exchange of fresh air in a room mainly occurs through the walls’ pores. Pettenkofer likely failed to properly seal the chimney and ceilings for the air exchange measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s where we come to a halt. What is Pettenkofer doing? He was a very successful scientist. But he was sometimes wrong. Interestingly, Pettenkofer came up with one of the precursors to the periodic table of elements. He had to stop his work due to a lack of funding from the Bavarian state. In 1869, however, Dmitri Mendeleev, the discoverer of the periodic system, mentioned Pettenkofer in his articles as one of the few who influenced his work. Pettenkofer only looked at what he could see. His thought process was bound to the observable and the instruments he uses.\nNow, we will learn about the philosophy of science. We will use Pettenkofer as an example. We will meet other people with strange ideas later on. Strange ideas are also science. It’s thinking outside the box. From a philosophical point of view, who was Pettenkofer? He was a positivist. This is a specific philosophical approach to acquiring knowledge. Positivists only believe in what can be seen or observed. If you wear glasses, you may notice a slight flaw in the argument about what is and isn’t observable while reading this book.\nBefore explaining different philosophies in science, we will take a brief detour into logical reasoning. Logic is necessary from time to time, so we will first cover the basics of inductive and deductive reasoning.\n\n\n1.1.2 Two paths of logic\nLogic is a tool for finding truth. The word “logic” originated from the Greek word logos, meaning “word,” “reason,” or “discourse.” Therefore, logic is essentially the art of making sense. But be careful. Logic is merely a tool and is not the ultimate determiner of truth. Logic is built up in chains of statements. There are two ways to form logical chains: One is from the bottom up, and the other is from the top down. We call the bottom-up approach inductive reasoning and the top-down approach deductive reasoning.\nThe following Figure 1.2 illustrates both logical pathways. On the left is inductive reasoning. We start with an observation, or data, and try to find a pattern in it. These patterns are called laws or models. These patterns can be thought of as mathematical formulas or statements that describe the patterns in the observations. From these patterns, we try to find an overarching theme. This theme is our conclusion or theory. Therefore, we start with specific numbers and spreadsheets and try to derive general rules from them. This is how you do inductive reasoning.\nOn the right, we find deductive reasoning. First, we have a general theory, and then we deduce an experiment from it. In other words, we have a theory and then imagine an experiment to test it. This experiment can be a thought experiment or a physical experiment as large as a particle collider. Based on the results of the experiment, we can then draw conclusions about our theory. Therefore, we can see deductive reasoning as a top-down approach. We start with a general theory and draw more specific conclusions from experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The difference between the two logical pathways: On the left is the inductive logic, which is a bottom-up approach that goes from specific to general. First, we observe and collect data, then we look for patterns in the data. Then, we draw a general conclusion about the pattern. After observing something a few times, we conclude that it is probably a rule. On the right is the deductive logic, a top-down approach from general to specific. We have a general theory and conduct an experiment to test it. Then, we draw a conclusion. From a more common perspective, the two logical pathways have things in common but differ in their train of thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogic is a tool, not a science. This is important for this chapter. We can create any logical chain, but that does not mean the chain contains truth or describes reality. Often, we do not know which reasoning we are applying, but it is usually inductive reasoning. In statistical modeling, we often use inductive reasoning. We start with data and try to find patterns in our observations. Conversely, pure deductive reasoning starts with an assumed truth and moves toward a conclusion. Sometimes, in science, the starting point is pure creative guesswork. Therefore, some scientific approaches use parts of deductive reasoning, but they do not start with a truth; rather, they start with a guess.\nNow, let’s take a closer look at knowledge generation concepts. There are many different ideas out there. Some are outdated, some have had a huge impact, and some have lived on in other philosophies. Most scientists don’t have a philosophy at hand, but they do science. Philosophy is often not taught in schools, so everyone is doing something as long as it works. Therefore, I tried to provide an overview of the most important philosophies that you might follow in part or that might have an impact on this book.\n\n\n1.1.3 Scientific philosophies\nWe will discuss statistical modeling later in this book. Statistical modeling does not come from nowhere; it includes parts of knowledge generation. However, it is susceptible to other philosophies and can be used in different ways. We want to explore these philosophies because they occasionally touch topics related to statistics. Statistics are founded in a historical context, so we will take a closer look at that. In statistics, it is common to observe things and then generate data. Statistics can also be seen as data analysis. Therefore, we start with the observable.\nHow does the human mind learn? How do we gather information? Humans are born in a blank state. No ideas are implanted in the brain; only instincts guide the infant through the first weeks and months. Shortly after, the infant begins to learn through the senses. This is mostly true and forms the basis of empiricism. I will not focus on human development. Therefore, we will only focus on the origin of empiricism as a basis for generating knowledge. The idea of empiricism is simple and appealing. In my experience, common sense often begins with empiricism to gather knowledge. Therefore, we will start with this simple idea and explain its history.\nWe conclude that empiricism is the source of knowledge, and that observation and sensory experience provide that source. We learn through our five senses, which shape our ideas. The focus is on the human mind.\nNext, we will broaden the scope of empiricism by asking how science and society should function. Since we have learned through our senses, we can apply this idea to science and society in general. Since we will focus only on observable things and dismiss invisible entities, we will call our concept positivism. Positivism comes from the Latin word positum, meaning “that which is given” or “laid down.” No, this does not make it any better. Positivism was founded by Auguste Comte (1798-1857) in the early nineteenth century. Comte also favored the idea of the verifiability criterion of meaning. According to this criterion, a statement must be empirically verifiable. We will meet this criterion again soon. Furthermore, we must distinguish between two completely different concepts that often pop up in our minds. Positivism is often confused with positive thinking. This is a common linguistic mistake, but positivism and positive thinking are not related. One is a rigorous philosophy of science, while the other is a psychological mindset or self-help technique.\nIn positivism, we can say that the validity of knowledge comes from observation and sensory experience, but it ignores everything invisible or immeasurable. In other words, if you cannot measure or observe something, it shouldn’t be part of a serious discussion.\nNow, let’s turn the wheel of positivism a bit further towards the extreme. Therefore, we must visit Vienna in the early 19th century. The Vienna Circle was a group of philosophers who met at the University of Vienna from 1924 to 1936. They had a big influence on the study of philosophy and science. In 1929, the Vienna Circle wrote “The Scientific Conception of the World”, also known as “The Manifesto.” The manifesto had two aims. First, it introduces the group and Vienna. At the beginning of the text, it reads more like an advertisement for Vienna and the Vienna Circle. More scientists should join the club. The philosophical main points are somewhat buried in the text. The Vienna Circle proposed that science is both empirical and positivist; knowledge comes only from experience. Furthermore, the process of scientific world conception involves applying logical analysis to observed objects, or, in other words, experience. A statement can only be meaningful if it is testable. This is called the verification principle.\nIn logical positivism, we conclude that knowledge is valid when acquired through sensory experience by integrating modern methods of mathematics and logic. For a statement to be meaningful, it must be testable through observation. It must either be proven true by logic (an analytic statement) or by experimentation (a synthetic statement). Thus, the verification principle is introduced.\nPositivism has a strong influence on the social structures of science and, consequently, on individual scientists. One such scientist was Ernst Mach (1838-1916). Mach greatly impacted the philosophy of knowledge generation with his Machian physics. Machian physics rejects Newtonian theories of space and time, supporting a relative approach to motion instead. Mach’s work inspired Albert Einstein in his search for the theory of general relativity. Machian physics is based entirely on directly observable phenomena. During his lifetime, Mach rejected the existence of atoms. Ultimately, Einstein rejected the positivist aspect of Machian physics, yet many scientists still considered him a positivist. The thinking goes that, since he supported Mach, he also supported the philosophy behind it. Science is always done in a social context.\nThe following figure summaries the three concepts, from empiricism to logical positivism. There is significant overlap between these concepts. However, the concepts become stricter and focus more on science emerging from the individual human in empiricism. We remember that truth comes from observable things and that statements must be verified by tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The intertwining of the three concepts from empiricism to logical positivism. First, there is empiricism, which is based on individual observations and experiences. Positivism attempts to apply this to society and science by disregarding the invisible and immeasurable. Only measurable things should be used in serious scientific discussions. Finally, logical positivism incorporates testable statements and the verification principle into the validity of knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does it matter? From a casual point of view, most parts of positivism makes perfect sense. We see something, come up with an explanation, and test if the explanation is true. This is a very casual concept in science. We are seeker after truth. Later in this book, we will focus on experiments and observations from experiments. These observations are called data. We don’t always need an experiment to gather data; we can also observe nature and draw inferences from it.\nIn our daily scientific work, we produce data that consists of observations. Therefore, we are drawn to the logical positivism approach. It makes sense to believe only in what we can see and disregard everything else.\nHowever, there is a problem. Or to write it in the words of John Passmore, who said: “Logical positivism is dead—or as dead as a philosophical movement can be.” If logical positivism is no longer working, then it never was. Then, we will need a different philosophy on which to base our science. As scientific workers, we could also adopt another philosophy. Statistics is a basket of flowers full of algorithms and models. We can choose from many of them and apply them to data. In this case, the focus is on the algorithm or model. If we only care about them, we follow a different philosophy. Instead of focusing on the observable, we focus on the algorithm that works best as a tool or instrument.\n“Shut up and calculate!”2, it is more or less its origin in the philosophy of instrumentalism. The idea of instrumentalism is not far from logical positivism. Positivism is based on the observable. We only believe in knowledge gathered from visible things. Therefore, we focus on the what. Instrumentalism also looks at things and tries to describe them. Pierre Duhem (1861-1916) first developed the idea of instrumentalism. This philosophy uses mathematical models or logic to predict and explain nature. However, it doesn’t matter if the mathematics describe some type of truth. As long as the mathematics or models work, everything is fine. If there is a deviation, the math can be adapted through knowledge generation. Instrumentalism only focuses on the how and does not ask if there is a theoretical background behind a model as long as the model works. Maybe particles exist or maybe they don’t. Everything is merely a means to make predictions. Even if the model fails, it is only a technical hiccup that must be repaired. A scientific theory is merely a tool that humans use to predict observations in a particular domain of nature by formulating rules. Therefore, instrumentalism is also a prominent form of anti-realism in science. We have useful models that produce successful predictions. We do not need to know whether something like atoms or genes actually exists. A theory can work perfectly well even if it is false. Something is true because it works. In anti-realism, we also focus on what we can measure and use to make predictions. The existence of the moon is irrelevant if there is no one to witness it.\nIn instrumentalism, we conclude that a theory of knowledge should be useful. We use rules as instruments and tools to predict observations. The statements do not need to describe reality or unobservables as long as the rules produce stable success. It’s not worth asking what would happen if nobody was watching.\nAs a statistical worker, the danger of instrumentalism is believing in our models too much. It is to love the process of testing and evaluating models and benchmarks. We find the functional tools, but it doesn’t matter if these tools are based in reality. Statistical models should be useful and work.\nIn 1943, Ayn Rand (1905-1982) introduced objectivism as a philosophy of strong realism and a rejection of mysticism, and all forms of religion. At the heart of her philosophy is the heroic human, capable of anything through the power of the mind. At its core, objectivism is optimistic and guided by reason. Rand chose the name because objectivism is bound to reality. Objects exist independently of consciousness, and knowledge can be attained through inductive logic. Therefore, whether or not something can be measured or observed is irrelevant. The philosophy has a drawback in that it uses a verification principle derived from induction. Therefore, we observe and discover the truth. This is not ideal by any means. Finally, objectivism puts humans at the center, and humans are able to understand reality through reason. As a non-academic, Rand’s philosophy lived a niche existence.\nDo you remember Pettenkofer and his fight against cholera? He focused on observable factors, such as who died and who stayed healthy, and discovered the importance of sanitation. He used the sewage and freshwater systems to cure cholera. Or maybe to just prevent it? Science works. Where is the problem?\nAt this point, we can finally reference a famous saying in statistics: Georg Box said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” I don’t know why, but the saying always annoyed me in a subtle way. Now that I understand the connection between instrumentalism and anti-realism, I know why I dislike them. From my perspective, there is a reality, even if no one is watching. Therefore, not all models can be wrong. The moon exists, and it follows a trajectory described by a formula, or more generally, by a statement or law. The movement does not stop and the moon does not vanish if no one is watching. Therefore, there is a true model of the moon’s movement. This brings us to the final philosophy I would like to introduce. I will address all its problems in the context of statistical modeling for the rest of the book.\nNow we will learn the philosophy of critical realism or critical rationalism. Sometimes, the lines between different philosophies become blurred. Here, we need the core principles of the philosophies, not their minor differences. Critical realism asks: “What must the world be like for science to be possible?” For science to be possible, the world cannot be a collection of random events. Reality must be understandable, orderly, and accessible to the human mind through observation and reason. Science depends on a realistic worldview. We believe that the world is real, not just a dream, but a structured place waiting to be understood. If the world were a chaotic jumble of “useful models,” as instrumentalism suggests, or a series of perceptions, as positivism claims, science would not function as well as it does. We can conduct experiments in a laboratory and apply them to a star millions of miles away. This suggests that there are objective, universal mechanisms at work.\nIn his 1959 book The Logic of Scientific Discovery3, Karl Popper introduced one big idea: The falsification principle states that statements should be falsifiable. Falsifiability was introduced. We will call it falsification in this book. The idea behind the falsification principle is simple. You cannot prove any theory by induction. This is because induction is based on observations. It is impossible to observe all possible instances. A classic example is the idea that all swans are white. It is impossible to observe all swans, so you can never be sure that all swans are truly white. However, if you observe one black swan, you can reject your statement. Again, there is a drawback here. All of our statements or hypotheses must be testable and falsifiable. If our statement cannot be tested, or if no experiment can produce a false result, we cannot make a decision about our statement. Ultimately, falsification means there is no truth in science. Knowledge is not verified. Knowledge grows by proving us wrong, not right. This is an unpleasant idea in common sense. As scientists, we actively try to disprove our theories, searching for the weak points that will break them. In doing so, we hope to find a better explanation or theory.\nThere is one major problem with Popper’s idea of falsification. We could end up with no theory at all. If we reject a hypothesis, statement, or even a whole theory, nothing is left. In his book The beginning of infinity: Explanations that transform the world5, David Deutsch extends Popper’s ideas. Deutsch introduced the good explanation. Science is not only about making predictions, but also about explaining reality. Therefore, reality exists and can be described. A good explanation is “hard-to-vary.” We cannot easily change parts of a theory to fit a particular story which came into our mind. If you can’t imagine an experiment that could prove your theory wrong, then you’re not doing science, you’re telling stories. Consequently, good explanations are easy to falsify. A hard-to-vary explanation makes specific predictions. These predictions are easy to test. Therefore, we use the process of falsification to test our explanations and theories. Unlike Popper, we do not discard a theory that has been partially falsified unless we have a better explanation. We conserve our theories if we do not have a better one. We also want to know why a theory is false. Understanding this is important for developing better theories. In addition, good explanations have a wide reach. We can use them for different objects and implementations. The explanation of Newtonian gravity, for example, has a wide reach. It allows us to calculate the orbits of planets, predict comets, and build bridges. Each scientist’s goal should be to find explanations with a wide reach. For Popper and Deutsch, the falsification principle is the demarcation line of science. With this principle, we can distinguish between science and non-science.\nDeutsch suggests a deductive scientific approach. We should make a bold guess about how reality works. This is the creative aspect of the human mind. Humans are universal explainers, capable of solving any problem with the right knowledge. The guess should be an explanation that is difficult to vary. Then, we design experiments to test the theory under all circumstances. In doing so, we will falsify parts or all of it and learn new things. We will find an intermediate truth as a new starting point for further guessing.\nWhy does Deutsch prefer deductive reasoning over inductive reasoning? First, there is no logical link between something happening before and it happening again. Just because something happened and was observed does not mean that the observation will always occur in the future. Past patterns of observations do not create future laws. Without an explanation of why something happened, the pattern you observe may be misleading. Furthermore, you cannot simply make an observation. Each observation is theory-laden. This is a somewhat cumbersome term that claims you must have an idea about what you want to observe in order to make an observation. This idea of what to observe is a pre-existing theory that allows you to see the data as meaningful. Sometimes the explicit theory is hidden from the scientist.\nIf science operated on an inductive basis, we would be limited by observations and measurements alone. We would not be able to explore the unobservable realms of reality. Knowledge is creative and can therefore explain things we may never see, such as black holes or atoms. We don’t need to see them; we only need a good explanation for them. According to induction, knowledge comes from outside the world. However, Deutsch argues that it is the other way around. According to him, knowledge comes from within the human mind through the process of formulating and falsifying theories.\nFinally, you can forget everything we have learned so far and throw it out the window. Verification, falsification, reach, good explanations, and all the rest are torn down. Follow Paul Karl Feyerabend and his anarchy model from the book Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge1. In short, there is no scientific model. Everything goes. Feyerabend believed that falsification can kill great ideas before they have a chance to flourish. Additionally, many explanations offer more possibilities, providing more room for new thoughts and knowledge generation. Generally, it was the outlaws, such as Galileo, Einstein, and Newton, who brought new ideas and theories into being. Therefore, any structure in science is false. Science is an anachronistic process.\n\n\n1.1.4 Wheel of knowledge\nSo far, we have explored several different scientific philosophies. Besides the question of which philosophy is true—which is a different question altogether—we want to ask: Is there a process in science? Is the generation of knowledge a linear process, a piling up of knowledge, or more of a journey through knowledge?\nIn his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions4, Thomas S. Kuhn proposed a revolutionary idea about how knowledge is generated. Figure 1.4 shows that knowledge generation runs through cycles. There are stable states of science, known as normal science. In this state, scientists solve puzzles and problems within the existing framework of knowledge. These ideas are socially accepted, and fundamental novelties are passively suppressed by the system itself. Everyone is doing their work, and that’s fine. From time to time, however, anomalies in models or observations occur. We see a drift away from stable science. At first, it is a back-and-forth, but as more and more anomalies pile up, it becomes clear that something is going on. These anomalies cannot be explained by experimental errors or noise in the measurements anymore. There is social pushback, but it becomes weaker.\nThen, we observed a crack in the system. A crisis arose. This is the breaking point of the theory. The observed anomalies became so severe that they could no longer be ignored. Tension and frustration spread through the scientific community. Next, new candidates of reality emerge. We see new tools and theories from mostly young scientists who want to start a revolution. Science shifts into a new state of reality, adopting a new language, social structures such as journals and conferences, and a new framework of knowledge. We establish a new paradigm. From there, we enter another stable phase of science. This cycle runs endlessly. We are not just piling up knowledge; it is a process of moving through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The paradigm shift cycle, also known as the Kuhn Cycle after its inventor. The cycle describes how science evolves over time. Normal science is stable and attempts to solve puzzles and problems within a given framework. From time to time, anomalies occur that do not fit the common sense of the current science. These anomalies are usually seen as experimental error, resulting in a social pushback. Eventually, the anomalies pile up, and a crisis occurs. This marks a crack in the stable science. From there, a revolution occurs, and candidates of reality comes into being. Finally, a new paradigm of reality emerges. In this new paradigm, new languages and a new framework of science are established. Then, normal science begins again. There is a strong social component to this cycle because humans often resist fundamental changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the central idea of Kuhn is the paradigm shift. Every science has a paradigm that holds everything together. The social aspect is also important. Science is done by humans within a social structure. Within a paradigm, some thoughts are permitted, while others are considered fundamentally wrong. Therefore, in a stable, normal scientific environment, new fundamental changes do not occur. Scientific careers are shaped by the paradigm, as are funding and resources. If you want to do something new, you will have to face resistance.\nAnother key point of Kuhn’s idea of the paradigm shift is the incommensurability of paradigms. Incommensurability is a difficult word that means something cannot be compared. “Incomparable” is a simpler word that means the same thing. We can compare Newtonian mechanics to Einstein’s general relativity. Both paradigms describe the effects of gravity on bodies in space. However, Newtonian mechanics does not explain why gravity works. Einstein introduced a geometric view of the effects of gravity in four-dimensional space, introducing not only space, but also spacetime. The two theories are incomparable and cannot be used together. Only one can be true. Einstein’s theory produces better predictions in extreme situations and is therefore better. But, returning to Deutsch, Newtonian gravity still works and provides explanations for everyday problems. We can use both.\nSo far, we have not clearly defined what science is. However, in Kuhn’s cycle, there is also a state of pre-science. For humankind, this would be the phase before the Age of Enlightenment (1687–1789), when myths, alchemy, cults, and witchcraft dominated. There were rules of thumb and other farmers’ rules that structured some knowledge. If something worked, it was more or less due to luck. However, even witchcraft has rules and, therefore, a paradigm for working with its statements. Later in this chapter, we will introduce some cults of pseudoscience and their structures.\nNewton and Einstein parallel",

    "text": "1.2 The two paths of logic.\nPure deductive reasoning starts with a true assumed to be true and move toward a certain conclusion. Here we start with guessing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The difference between the two logical pathways: On the left is the inductive logic, which is a bottom-up approach that goes from specific to general. First, we observe and collect data, then we look for patterns in the data. Then, we draw a general conclusion about the pattern. After observing something a few times, we conclude that it is probably a rule. On the right is the deductive logic, a top-down approach from general to specific. We have a general theory and conduct an experiment to test it. Then, we draw a conclusion. From a more common perspective, the two logical pathways have things in common but differ in their train of thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s take a closer look at the concepts of empiricism to logical positivism.\n\n1.2.1 A maze of knowledge generation\nWe will discuss statistical modeling later in this book. Statistical modeling does not come from nowhere; it includes parts of knowledge generation. However, it is susceptible to other philosophies and can be used in different ways. We want to explore these philosophies because they occasionally touch topics related to statistics. Statistics are founded in a historical context, so we will take a closer look at that. In statistics, it is common to observe things and then generate data. Statistics can also be seen as data analysis. Therefore, we start with the observable.\nHow does the human mind learn? How do we gather information? Humans are born in a blank state. No ideas are implanted in the brain; only instincts guide the infant through the first weeks and months. Shortly after, the infant begins to learn through the senses. This is mostly true and forms the basis of empiricism. I will not focus on human development. Therefore, we will only focus on the origin of empiricism as a basis for generating knowledge. The idea of empiricism is simple and appealing. In my experience, common sense often begins with empiricism to gather knowledge. Therefore, we will start with this simple idea and explain its history.\nWe conclude that empiricism is the source of knowledge, and that observation and sensory experience provide that source. We learn through our five senses, which shape our ideas. The focus is on the human mind.\nNext, we will broaden the scope of empiricism by asking how science and society should function. Since we have learned through our senses, we can apply this idea to science and society in general. Since we will focus only on observable things and dismiss invisible entities, we will call our concept positivism. Positivism comes from the Latin word positum, meaning “that which is given” or “laid down.” No, this does not make it any better. Positivism was founded by Auguste Comte (1798-1857) in the early nineteenth century. Comte also favored the idea of the verifiability criterion of meaning. According to this criterion, a statement must be empirically verifiable. We will meet this criterion again soon. Furthermore, we must distinguish between two completely different concepts that often pop up in our minds. Positivism is often confused with positive thinking. This is a common linguistic mistake, but positivism and positive thinking are not related. One is a rigorous philosophy of science, while the other is a psychological mindset or self-help technique.\nIn positivism, we can say that the validity of knowledge comes from observation and sensory experience, but it ignores everything invisible or immeasurable. In other words, if you cannot measure or observe something, it shouldn’t be part of a serious discussion.\nNow, let’s turn the wheel of positivism a bit further towards the extreme. Therefore, we must visit Vienna in the early 19th century. The Vienna Circle was a group of philosophers who met at the University of Vienna from 1924 to 1936. They had a big influence on the study of philosophy and science. In 1929, the Vienna Circle wrote “The Scientific Conception of the World”, also known as “The Manifesto.” The manifesto had two aims. First, it introduces the group and Vienna. At the beginning of the text, it reads more like an advertisement for Vienna and the Vienna Circle. More scientists should join the club. The philosophical main points are somewhat buried in the text. The Vienna Circle proposed that science is both empirical and positivist; knowledge comes only from experience. Furthermore, the process of scientific world conception involves applying logical analysis to observed objects, or, in other words, experience. A statement can only be meaningful if it is testable. This is called the verification principle.\nIn logical positivism, we conclude that knowledge is valid when acquired through sensory experience by integrating modern methods of mathematics and logic. For a statement to be meaningful, it must be testable through observation. It must either be proven true by logic (an analytic statement) or by experimentation (a synthetic statement). Thus, the verification principle is introduced.\nPositivism has a strong influence on the social structures of science and, consequently, on individual scientists. One such scientist was Ernst Mach (1838-1916). Mach greatly impacted the philosophy of knowledge generation with his Machian physics. Machian physics rejects Newtonian theories of space and time, supporting a relative approach to motion instead. Mach’s work inspired Albert Einstein in his search for the theory of general relativity. Machian physics is based entirely on directly observable phenomena. During his lifetime, Mach rejected the existence of atoms. Ultimately, Einstein rejected the positivist aspect of Machian physics, yet many scientists still considered him a positivist. The thinking goes that, since he supported Mach, he also supported the philosophy behind it. Science is always done in a social context.\nThe following figure summaries the three concepts, from empiricism to logical positivism. There is significant overlap between these concepts. However, the concepts become stricter and focus more on science emerging from the individual human in empiricism. We remember that truth comes from observable things and that statements must be verified by tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The intertwining of the three concepts from empiricism to logical positivism. First, there is empiricism, which is based on individual observations and experiences. Positivism attempts to apply this to society and science by disregarding the invisible and immeasurable. Only measurable things should be used in serious scientific discussions. Finally, logical positivism incorporates testable statements and the verification principle into the validity of knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does it matter? From a casual point of view, most parts of positivism makes perfect sense. We see something, come up with an explanation, and test if the explanation is true. This is a very casual concept in science. We are seeker after truth. Later in this book, we will focus on experiments and observations from experiments. These observations are called data. We don’t always need an experiment to gather data; we can also observe nature and draw inferences from it.\nIn our daily scientific work, we produce data that consists of observations. Therefore, we are drawn to the logical positivism approach. It makes sense to believe only in what we can see and disregard everything else.\nHowever, there is a problem. Or to write it in the words of John Passmore, who said: “Logical positivism is dead—or as dead as a philosophical movement can be.” If logical positivism is no longer working, then it never was. Then, we will need a different philosophy on which to base our science. As scientific workers, we could also adopt another philosophy. Statistics is a basket of flowers full of algorithms and models. We can choose from many of them and apply them to data. In this case, the focus is on the algorithm or model. If we only care about them, we follow a different philosophy. Instead of focusing on the observable, we focus on the algorithm that works best as a tool or instrument.\n“Shut up and calculate!”2, it is more or less its origin in the philosophy of instrumentalism. The idea of instrumentalism is not far from logical positivism. Positivism is based on the observable. We only believe in knowledge gathered from visible things. Therefore, we focus on the what. Instrumentalism also looks at things and tries to describe them. Pierre Duhem (1861-1916) first developed the idea of instrumentalism. This philosophy uses mathematical models or logic to predict and explain nature. However, it doesn’t matter if the mathematics describe some type of truth. As long as the mathematics or models work, everything is fine. If there is a deviation, the math can be adapted through knowledge generation. Instrumentalism only focuses on the how and does not ask if there is a theoretical background behind a model as long as the model works. Maybe particles exist or maybe they don’t. Everything is merely a means to make predictions. Even if the model fails, it is only a technical hiccup that must be repaired. A scientific theory is merely a tool that humans use to predict observations in a particular domain of nature by formulating rules. Therefore, instrumentalism is also a prominent form of anti-realism in science. We have useful models that produce successful predictions. We do not need to know whether something like atoms or genes actually exists. A theory can work perfectly well even if it is false. Something is true because it works. In anti-realism, we also focus on what we can measure and use to make predictions. The existence of the moon is irrelevant if there is no one to witness it.\nIn instrumentalism, we conclude that a theory of knowledge should be useful. We use rules as instruments and tools to predict observations. The statements do not need to describe reality or unobservables as long as the rules produce stable success. It’s not worth asking what would happen if nobody was watching.\nAs a statistical worker, the danger of instrumentalism is believing in our models too much. It is to love the process of testing and evaluating models and benchmarks. We find the functional tools, but it doesn’t matter if these tools are based in reality. Statistical models should be useful and work.\nIn 1943, Ayn Rand (1905-1982) introduced objectivism as a philosophy of strong realism and a rejection of mysticism, and all forms of religion. At the heart of her philosophy is the heroic human, capable of anything through the power of the mind. At its core, objectivism is optimistic and guided by reason. Rand chose the name because objectivism is bound to reality. Objects exist independently of consciousness, and knowledge can be attained through inductive logic. Therefore, whether or not something can be measured or observed is irrelevant. The philosophy has a drawback in that it uses a verification principle derived from induction. Therefore, we observe and discover the truth. This is not ideal by any means. Finally, objectivism puts humans at the center, and humans are able to understand reality through reason. As a non-academic, Rand’s philosophy lived a niche existence.\nDo you remember Pettenkofer and his fight against cholera? He focused on observable factors, such as who died and who stayed healthy, and discovered the importance of sanitation. He used the sewage and freshwater systems to cure cholera. Or maybe to just prevent it? Science works. Where is the problem?\nAt this point, we can finally reference a famous saying in statistics: Georg Box said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” I don’t know why, but the saying always annoyed me in a subtle way. Now that I understand the connection between instrumentalism and anti-realism, I know why I dislike them. From my perspective, there is a reality, even if no one is watching. Therefore, not all models can be wrong. The moon exists, and it follows a trajectory described by a formula, or more generally, by a statement or law. The movement does not stop and the moon does not vanish if no one is watching. Therefore, there is a true model of the moon’s movement. This brings us to the final philosophy I would like to introduce. I will address all its problems in the context of statistical modeling for the rest of the book.\nIn his 1959 book The Logic of Scientific Discovery3, Karl Popper introduced one big idea: The falsification principle states that statements should be falsifiable. Falsifiability was introduced. We will call it falsification in this book.\nThe beginning of infinity: Explanations that transform the world by David Deutsch5\n\nGood explanation\nReach\nTheory-laden\n\nFinally, we forget everything we have learned so far and throw it out the window. Verification, falsification, reach, good explanations, and all the rest are torn down.

    "text": "1.3 Old start\nThe first chapter of this book is already the hardest. I started writing this chapter very early on, perhaps even before any of the others. Yet it took the longest to finish. The question is simple: What is science? The more I researched, the more complicated the answer became. Or the other way around. I followed the advice of Wolfgang Pauli. Pauli defined the scientific method as “taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.” Therefore, I tried to read and find answers to the question of what science might be. Perhaps science is, at its core, something personal. However, science also has objective aspects that I want to present here. Ultimately, decide for yourself what science truly is.\nThe following Figure 1.6 shows the demarcation line between science and non-science. In the next sections, we will discuss each specific part, but I think it’s important to start with a clear overview. Science is distinguished from non-science through experimentation and falsification. This is true in this book. There are many subtle definitions, but I will keep it simple here. If an experiment is not possible, then it is not science. We also need the ability to build a falsification framework. Therefore, we need hypotheses that can be rejected by experimentation. These two requirements are met by the natural sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology, in order of their purity. Biology includes medicine and all other fields of knowledge gathered from living things. In addition to natural science, there is formal science, which can be seen as a tool of science. This is due to the lack of experimentation, falsification, or both. Therefore, we will not include mathematics, logic, or theoretical computer science as sciences. True non-science fields are intuition-based or subjective at their core. There are many of these fields, and we will discuss them shortly. The humanities are undoubtedly different from non-science, but this book is not about the humanities, so we will put them aside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Visualization of the demarcation line of science. This line divides science from non-science through experimentation and the principle of falsification. The purity of science fields is taken from xkcd comic #435 (https://xkcd.com/435). According to this definition, natural science, including physics, chemistry, and biology, is separated from formal science, including mathematics. Formal science must be clearly distinguished from other intuition-based and subjective non-science, such as pseudoscience or anti-science. The humanities are indisputably different but are also considered non-science in this schematic.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps we should start with the supposedly easy part. What is the opposite of science? In doing so, we will gain an understanding of the term “science” and what it means to us. This may be the deepest lesson for me: we cannot really grasp science. Science is connected to each person in a different emotional way. Science seems cold and rational, but humans are not. Therefore, our relationship with science is strange and complex. Science is its own way of thinking, perhaps a philosophy. Therefore, there are as many ways of thinking as there are human minds.",

    "text": "1.3 What is the opposite of science?\nAs I found out, there is no direct opposite of science. That’s interesting. Sometimes, you can define something by knowing what it is not. You might think this is not so problematic. Take a few minutes to ask yourself: “What is the opposite of science?” Okay, good to have your focus back on the page. Maybe you thought science was cold and rational. I will share my personal story with science. For me, science was Star Trek: Enterprise. But I’m too young for Kirk and Spock. So, I was socialized with Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). That’s where I first encountered Shakespeare, but that’s another story. In TNG, science was determined by the exploration of new worlds. I would sit comfortably on the open bridge in front of the gigantic viewscreen. Commander Data was the embodiment of science. He was an android. He was rational and cold, devoid of emotion and humor. Let’s flip these attributes.\nIf an android is science, then what is a human? Then is the human the opposite of science? Perhaps there is some truth to that. Humans have lived on this planet for thousands of years, but science as we know it began during the Enlightenment. So perhaps humans are the opposite of science. Human beings are full of emotions and feelings. Each one is very subjective and interested in their own development. They feel love and romance. Neither of these is very scientific. Humans also believe. Some believe in a more structured manner, like in big churches, while others believe in a more individual manner. However, believing in something has nothing to do with science. But humans do science. Therefore, science is part of humanity. As Joshua Schimel said, “Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears. Our emotions are crucial to its development, and it cannot be truly understood as some bloodless, emotionless enterprise.”6 Science is a human endeavor.\nAccording to Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”7 Is magic therefore the opposite of science? We cannot perform magic. We do not have the power to do so. However, some humans believe that we can perform magic. Who is “we”? The advanced part of humankind. We come into contact with our brothers and sisters who are at a different technological level, such as tribal cultures on isolated islands in Indonesia. To a tribe with a primitive culture, our technology seems like magic. Here, we can observe the cargo cult. A cargo cult is named after its appearance in World War II. The US Army faced the challenge of determining the best island-hopping route to mainland Japan. Since no one knew and the tides of war were constantly changing, the US Army Logistics Corps decided to drop cargo everywhere. This way, if US soldiers approached an island, there would already be plenty of supplies.\nWhat happened to the indigenous population? They believed that the gods had come to bring them cargo. They could not think of any other explanation for what they observed. They observed hardened silver birds dropping and landing on the islands. After a while, the gods stopped showing up. The war was over. But nobody told them. Therefore, the people of the islands copied the gods’ behavior. They built the control room, and they made a radar station out of grass and wood. They even built plans out of grass. Nothing could work. They did everything perfectly, but they missed the point entirely. It was a cargo cult, not science. They copied someone else’s routine and hoped to experience what the gods experienced when they did the same.\nDo you follow a cargo cult in your daily routines? Do you do things that you have seen but don’t understand? Do you believe that they will work even though you don’t know why? This is totally human and from my point of view totally necessary to be a working community member. Some stuff must be done, even if I don not really understand the why. But what if we do it in science? Then we will do cargo cult science8. It is a danger of enormous proportions if done in the wrong place with the wrong intentions. Still, most intentions are good and are twisted by the circumstances. There are several examples of following dogmatic rules and getting a catastrophic outcome. Later, we will explore different models of reality, including the Fukushima nuclear accident.\nFor now, I would like to conclude that the opposite of science is difficult to grasp. On the one hand, we could argue that human emotions and feelings are the opposite of cold, rational science. However, emotions are also the driving force behind human scientific inquiry. Therefore, we are doing something scientific by leaving the topic open for further research and looking for things that are not science.",

Conspiracy theories9,10 look like science and use science terms and tools. They play on a stage that looks like science but has no deeper foundation. It’s more like a nice story about humans harming other humans. However, conspiracy theories attempt to explain the world and often generate money for the storyteller. Therefore, I do not see conspiracy theories as the opposite of science. These conspiracy theories are non-science. Some theories have a historical basis, such as the hollow earth conspiracy theory. We will discuss the origin later. Conspiracy theories like to be retold, and in the process, they grow and multiply. To circumvent the proliferation of conspiracy theories, I will provide an illustration of the anti-conspiracy theory “Birds Aren’t Real” by Peter McIndoe.\nWhat does the movement claim? In short, the US government kills all birds in the US and replaces them with bird-looking drones. Birds sit on power lines to recharge and defecate on cars to mark them visually. The bird drones are there to spy on American citizens. The specifications are inconsistent and vary. This is a typical sign of a conspiracy theory. Finally, U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the government due to his reluctance to kill all the birds as cherry on top.\nWhat do conspiracy theories have in common? They all tell a good story. I personally find them more similar to fairy tales, with the standard Greek dramatic structure of one hero against an anonymous horde of evil. In addition, they all have in common a lack of experiment. They don’t even conduct a small experiment or propose a hypothesis to test. A testable hypothesis is rarely claimed. Even if a hypothesis is present, the story can easily be changed to maintain its purpose: to tell a good story. Here, we will not focus on conspiracy theories and how they work. This topic is beyond the scope of this book.\nThere is another field in which personal stories are the focus. Psychoanalysis uses direct dialogue between two people to help one of them. In psychoanalysis, there are also no experiments. History knows of long debates about whether psychoanalysis is a science or not, or to what extent. Psychoanalysis shares a similar fate to the Humanities in general. They are not considered science in the scope of this book either. Just because something is not a science does not make it bad. Many important things in life have nothing to do with science.",

    "text": "1.5 What is science?\nI have discussed what the opposite of science could be. We have thought about what science not to meant. Know I want to make a little bit more clear, what science supposedly is. We divide science into two parts. The natural sciences, which include beside others physics, chemistry and biology. With biology we include all the life sciences. The other part is the formal science. We see here the formal science as tools to do science. As formal science we have as the main fields the mathematics, logic and theoretical computer science.\nExperimentation and falsification lie at the core of science. We cannot reject an experiment. An experiment either takes place or it does not. However, a testable hypothesis can be rejected. This is sometimes referred to as the demarcation line of science, which is used to determine whether a field belongs to the natural sciences. In this book, we will use formal science to study the natural sciences. We need formal science as a tool.\nMeters of books have been written about the sciences. As at the beginning stated, there are different version and definitions. While I was writing what you are now reading, I found some literature I party read and find intriguing. We meet Karl Pearson again as a founder of statistics, but in 1892 he wrote the book “The grammar of science”11, which also inspired Einstein on his way to relativity.\nCan science be objective? “Science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind. […] In truth, the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.”\n“The classification of facts, the recognition of their sequence and relative significance is the function of science, and the habit of forming a judgment upon these facts unbiased by personal feeling is characteristic of what may be termed the scientific frame of mind.” Karl\nErsnt Mach (1838-1916) “Ernst Mach’s positivism is a subjective, anti-metaphysical philosophy of science that restricts legitimate knowledge exclusively to directly observable sensations and measurements. He rejected unobservable entities like atoms as”hypothetical fictions”,”\n12 What is this thing called Science?\n“In the same way, it is possible to follow form and call it science, but that is pseudo-science.”\n“It should not be”science has shown” but “this experiment, this effect, has shown.”\n“the result of the discovery that it is worthwhile rechecking by new direct experience, and not necessarily trusting the [human] race[’s] experience from the past.”\n13 What is science\n14 What is science?\nDavid Deutsch claimed that science is guessing and falsification. Or in his words, “Tte whole [scientific] process resembles biological evolution. A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche.”5\nWe conclude the following: A hypothesis should be testable through experimentation. The experiment should be designed in such a way that the hypothesis can be rejected. We need falsification. The experiment should also be reproducible; we will come to this point later.",

    "text": "1.6 How to do science?\nFrom now on I had to do a harsh decision. Science is broad, this book is in contrast slim. Therefore I will focus on the natural science. Especially, the life science, which includes all living things. Yes, some parts will also applicable to more technical fields like mechanical engineering and engineering sciences but only in a limited way. A building and the humans inside does not accept a error in its structure.\n“As a scientist, you are a professional writer,” Joshua Schimel said.6\nPauli defined the scientific method as “taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.”16. This is more or less about taking a chair and sitting in the middle of the room and getting bored as long as possible. Doing so sparks creativity.\nOtto Kruse stated in his book, “many scientific topics can only be solved once all aspects have been explicitly formulated. The mind is not sufficiently prepared for this, as it can only ever focus on small sections at a time. Systematic thinking is only possible when writing, i.e. recording the results of one’s thinking and relating them to other aspects.”17\nKnowlegde is evolution by Deutsch and Feynman\nComparision from induction to critical rationalism\nErst Mach and observational things.\nKarl Pearson what is reality.\nQuantum mechanics, we do not know what reality is.\nThe measurement paradox.

    "section": "1.7 What is statistics in science?",
    "text": "1.7 What is statistics in science?\nOn a warm spring day, I was sitting in my first statistics lecture. I don’t remember everything, but one quote from the beginning of the lecture has stuck with me: “Statistics is the engine room of science.” I think this quote might not have been spoken in this form. Rather, it was the underlying theme of the lecture.\nA toolbox of mathematical models to do science.\nIn this book we will use Fisherian statistics, which is inductive logic reasoning. Or in other words the logic of inductive inference.\nFisher switched from a mathematical deductive reasoning to a inductive reasoning in science. This is remarkable for me, because he changed the way he does science.\nStatistics by Fisher and quantum mechanics have in common that both do inductive probabilistic reasoning. Scientific models are deductive\nStatistical models are inductive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Inductive reasoning is a probabilistic process in statistics. First, a hypothesis is stated. Then, an experiment is conducted based on the hypothesis, and data is collected. This data is a random representation of observables. This is where the probabilistic process begins. Then, statistical modeling is applied to the experimental data to minimize noise. Finally, a conclusion is drawn. Sometimes the aim is to make a probabilistic decision or explanation, with or without prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDerivation of the formula for kinetic energy\n\n\n\nInductive reasoning seems a bit difficult to follow. Therefore, I conducted a small experiment to derive the formula for an object’s genetic energy, focusing on velocity. To make things easier, we will keep the mass constant. The formula is well-known; Newton discovered it. The formula for kinetic energy is \\(E_{kinetic} = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\). Therefore, we will take the mass of an object in kilograms and multiply it by the square of the velocity. Velocity is defined as follows: \\(v = \\tfrac{d}{t}\\). We divide the distance traveled by the time it takes the object to travel that distance. Now, I want to find the dependency between velocity and kinetic energy. To do so, I built the following apparatus. A \\(30\\)-gram (\\(0.03kg\\)) ball lies on a height-adjustable tower. The ball will travel a ramp without friction, covering a distance of \\(60cm\\) (\\(0.6m\\)) to the ground. At different heights, we will measure how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. Then, we can calculate the velocity in each trial. We know the ball’s energy at the top. At the top, we find the potential energy with \\(E_{potential} = mgh\\). We will multiply the ball’s mass by the acceleration due to gravity, which is \\(9.81 m/s^2\\), and the height of the tower. Since we are changing the height, the ball’s energy will also increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: The formula for kinetic energy can be derived through the following example experiment. A ball of fixed mass rolls down a fixed ramp from different heights. For each trial, the time it takes the ball to reach the bottom is measured with a stopwatch. The velocity can be calculated from the traveled distance and time. As the height increases, the ball will reach the ground in less time. Friction can be ignored. However, a measurement error will most likely occur in each trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s write everything down. We have the mass of the ball, \\(m = 0.03kg\\), the length of the ramp, \\(d = 2m\\), and the acceleration due to gravity, \\(g = 9.81 m/s^2\\). We put the tower at five different heights and let the ball roll. The ball runs surprisingly fast. Because we cannot perfectly adjust the height, and manual time measurement is error-prone, we obtain noisy velocity measurements. The observed data has an error. The table Table 1.1 includes the measured and calculated data.\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Results table from the experiment to determine the formula for kinetic energy. The height was changed five times. Using the acceleration due to gravity, the potential energy of the ball can be determined from its height and fixed weight. The ball’s speed can be determined from the rolling time and the fixed ramp length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight [m]\nPotential energy [J]\nTime [s]\nVelocity [m/s]\n\n\n\n\n\\(0.1\\)\n\\(0.1 \\cdot 0.03 \\cdot 9.81 = 0.029\\)\n\\(1.58\\)\n\\(2/1.58 = 1.27\\)\n\n\n\\(0.2\\)\n\\(0.059\\)\n\\(0.95\\)\n\\(2.11\\)\n\n\n\\(0.3\\)\n\\(0.088\\)\n\\(0.85\\)\n\\(2.36\\)\n\n\n\\(0.4\\)\n\\(0.118\\)\n\\(0.65\\)\n\\(3.09\\)\n\n\n\\(0.5\\)\n\\(0.147\\)\n\\(0.72\\)\n\\(2.78\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA table of data is nice, but most of us cannot really see anything in a table. Therefore, we will visualize our data throughout the book. The Figure 1.11 displays the five data points for the energy of the balls and the final velocity. The blue line shows the result of a statistical model. I ran a nonlinear regression to find the perfect line through the points. How did I do this? We will discuss modeling later in the book. In contrast, the purple line shows the actual dependency of velocity on energy. There is a deviation in our statistical model. We can visualize this deviation as an area of uncertainty in our plot. Due to this deviation, we cannot find the perfect formula. There are different ways to show statistical deviation. In general, the deviation is related to how far the individual observations or points are from the line drawn by the model. This process is called fitting a line through points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Visualization of the relationship between energy and velocity. The points represent calculated velocities from different heights. Due to measurement errors, the points do not fit perfectly on a line. The blue line is the formula derived from the data using a nonlinear model. The shaded area shows the uncertainty caused by measurement errors. The purple line shows the true dependency using the formula for kinetic energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from our small experiment? No matter what we do, there will always be an error, noise, or deviation. There are different names for nearly identical concepts. This is the core of inductive reasoning using statistics. We will always have errors, and we want to minimize them. The main topic of this book is what this error is and how we describe these errors. Not really the errors themselves, but rather the concept of drawing lines through points by minimizing error.\n\n\nRandomization and random observations",

She pushed the wall slightly with her hand. It was massive and stable.\n“No, it’s plastic. Pure plastic,” Jeff answered from the darkness. “But it feels real. Sometimes your senses tricked you.”\nEmma leaned over the wall. “The stones are perfect squares in the basement, but they’re getting smaller here in the walkway, like tiny dice,” Emma wondered.\n“It’s the optimum. The optimum.” Jeff spoke quietly.\nShe moved to the opposite side of the wall where the battlement walk was located. The castle was meant to be situated near Prague in Old Europe. The play was to concern the drama between Tycho Brahe and Nicolaus Copernicus. She wondered who would play them, but another question came to her mind first.\n“Why is it dark at night, Jeff?”\nThere was a long pause of silence and breathing. “Because the universe is expanding. The light is stretched out. The wavelength became longer and longer until the light could no longer be seen,” Jeff answered in a stoic undertone.\nEmma looked surprised. “Yesterday, I explained the issue with a stick, an orange, and a flashlight.”\nA pause of silence followed. “Your model was wrong,” Jeff stated.\n“It was useful and a lot of fun,” Emma answered, sounding annoyed. Her view was captured by the castle’s long walls, which stretched away like curved lines.\nImagine you are standing on a globe but still believe it is flat. This globe is called Earth. It is your home planet. So far, you know that you belong to the only existing intelligent species. You are standing on solid ground, with boiling rocks just a few kilometers below you. If you shrink the Earth to the size of an egg, the shell would represent the solid ground. A few kilometers above that, you would not be able to breathe. You are not moving right now, but the Earth is moving at speeds of up to 828,000 km/h depending on the reference point. Your reality is a serious misinterpretation. This chapter focuses on the important role of different models of reality. We will examine various historical examples of scientific work by humans. Theories were developed and predictions were made. Most of these predictions were incorrect. Only a few provided a satisfactory explanation of the reality we live in. We want to follow the historical paths and go where no one has gone before.\nDavid Deutsch: “To interpret dots in the sky as white-hot, million-kilometre spheres, one must first have thought of the idea of such spheres. And then one must explain why they look small and cold and seem to move in lockstep around us and do not fall down. Such ideas do not create themselves, nor can they be mechanically derived from anything: they have to be guessed – after which they can be criticized and tested.”1 ##\nWho are these humans, and what is their background? What have they achieved? The science in books loses its humanity. I am in your head, talking to you. You read about the achievements of men who created beautiful things. They had ideas that came out of nowhere. More or less, that’s how it seems. But they were human, and therefore interconnected with other people of their time. Or with the knowledge of their ancestors. I think it’s important to understand these connections in order to gain a better understanding of the theories scientists propose and how they should be judged from our perspective. All humans struggle when doing science. It takes a lot of courage to write down and publish something new. In Figure 3.1, you can see the people that we will cover in the first part of the chapter. We will focus on findings in our solar system. How does everything work behind the curtain of nature? Many people have spent a long time thinking about it and have invented marvellous things like telescopes and advanced mathematics to enlighten humanity.\nFigure 3.1: Dramatis personae in this chapter and their biographical details, as well as important scientific discoveries or hypotheses. Here, we consider scientists who have contributed to research into the celestial bodies in the solar system.

    "text": "3.2 Models of the sun system\nThis chapter tries to tell the story of different men. It also explores their sins. And their misinterpretations of reality. All had brilliant ideas and promoted humanity for the better, and their actions showed great compassion and understanding. History repeats itself, so you can learn a lot from these men. Later in the book, we will focus on fleas and their characteristics. This simple life form is used as a model organism in our search for meaning in statistical models. In this chapter, we look to the stars. Humans stare into the black night and ask many questions about the workings of nature. How do plants move? What are the forces and orbits? It took centuries to answer these questions, with many scientists working without telescopes or modern mathematics. Moreover, modern mathematics was invented as a tool for searching the sky. In the following Figure 3.2, you will see celestial bodies that will be important in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of a selection of celestial bodies in our solar system. All of these bodies can be observed and described using different attributes. The following sections discuss different models of these celestial bodies from previous centuries. First we discuss the hollow earth theory. Second the model of the habital sun. And as third example the deviation of the orbit of Mercury. Most of these models are wrong today, but they still cast shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 The hollow earth\nJohannes Kepler (1571–1630) was born into a world that believed the Earth was at the centre of the universe. The people of his time believed in a geocentric worldview. In 1543, Nikolaus Kopernikus (1473–1543) proposed a heliocentric model of the universe, with the Sun at the center and the Earth orbiting it in a circular path. Nevertheless, the heliocentric worldview was still under debate when Kepler began his work. He studied the data observed by the astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601). Brahe produced detailed observations of planetary movements. He made his observations without the use of a telescope. Brahe was meticulous about the accuracy of his measurements of planetary orbits, and was one of the first people to recognise the importance of making multiple observations. Brahe’s observations of Mars included the collection of all significant data on the planet’s position.\nIt was only on his deathbed that Brahe ordered Kepler to evaluate and publish his data. Kepler complied with this request. Until then, Brahe had rejected many of Kepler’s requests for access to the complete data tables. This is an early example of the importance of open data in research. Kepler found that the positional data for Mars deviated by eight arc minutes from the Copernican circular orbit. This small deviation led Kepler to propose elliptical orbits. Deviation is a key concept in science. To see a deviation and believe that it is a systematic one and not one of pure randomness or measurement error. We will come back to this again and again. Kepler believed in a systematic effect of the deviation and developed the three laws of planetary motion from there. This is also an early example of data acquisition and data science. Brahe produced the data, which Kepler then used data science to interpret.\nYou might now be wondering what an arcminute is. It is a unit of measurement for degrees. Therefore, one degree has 60 arc minutes, and one arc minute has 60 arc seconds. If you look at the full moon, you will see that it covers 32 arc minutes. Kepler therefore believed that the eight-arc-minute deviation in the orbit of Mars was a systematic failure of the 2,000-year-old theory, rather than an error in the measurements taken by its mentor, Tycho Brahe. Nevertheless, it took nearly two centuries of ongoing debate and research for Kepler’s work to take on its final, well-known form.\nFollowing the discovery of elliptical orbits, Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727) formulated the Newtonian theory of gravity. This new theory enabled humanity to calculate gravity on Earth, the Moon’s orbit around Earth, and the movement of the planets around the Sun. This is just one of many applications but not the first one. Edmond Halley (1656–1742) paid for the printing of Newton’s Principia, fascinated by the possibilities of Newton’s findings. Therefore he made one of the first usage of the formulas of Newton. Newton discovered that the Moon had a higher density than the Earth. Halley stated that the Moon and Earth are made of the same material. Therefore, the Earth could only be lighter if the Earth were hollow. However, Halley and Newton based their inaccurate density calculations on Newton’s theory of tides, which describes the movement of water in relation to the Moon’s mass and position. The calculations were wrong because they were based on false assumptions, resulting in an incorrect density ratio of \\(9/5\\) for the Moon and Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The hollow Earth model was born from a miscalculation by Newton, which led to Herschel’s theory. (A) Newton had calculated that the Moon was denser than the Earth. It was assumed that the two celestial bodies should have the same density. (B) Halley supposed that the Earth was hollow to make it lighter and achieve the same density ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there on thinks start to escalate quickly. Halley deeply believed, that the earth is hollow. When 80-year-old Halley was portrayed as Astronomer Royal, he had himself depicted with a diagram of the hollow earth. The model was also used to describe the polar lights that come from the internal sun breaking through the Earth’s crust. Halley later became famous for being fortunate enough to correctly predict the return of Halley’s Comet. At the time, the prediction was considered a significant achievement of Newton’s theory of gravity. However, this success was a one-off, since Newton’s theory of gravity is incorrect, as we will discuss later. The idea of a hollow Earth did not disappear completely. In literature, the most famous public work is the book “Journey to the Centre of the Earth” by Jules Verne. The hollow earth theory lives on in many conspiracy theories to this day.\n\n\n3.2.2 The habitable sun\nOur next example is about using a model with wrong assumptions to generate a theory of the habitable sun. For a modern reader, this sounds like an absolute joke, but in the time of Sir William Herschel (1738-1822), the idea was prominent. First, you must believe that everything has a purpose. Therefore, planets are meant to nurture life. Since there is life on Earth, every planet must have life. In other words, it is a human or anthropocentric world view. The sun is a planet. Why should the Sun be any different? The sun is a planet with luminous clouds. In addition, every planet is solid and has clouds.\nNow, we are standing on Earth and looking at the Sun. What can we see? Small black spots, also known as sunspots. These cannot be observed with the naked eye — this should never be done — but can be seen with a telescope and appropriate filters. So, what are these sunspots? Herschel proposed the following model. Imagine standing on the moon and looking down at the Earth through the clouds. The Earth is a blue planet of water and land. The same is true of the Sun. You can see through the luminous clouds onto the dark surface of the solid sun. In the Figure 3.4, you can see the train of thought of Herschel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The habitable sun theory is based on a lot of wrong assumptions about celestrial bodies in the solar system. (A) Observation of sunpots from the earth. (B) Model of the planetary sun. Herschel built the model by applying observations of the Earth standing on the Moon to the Sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday2\n\n\n3.2.3 The planet Vulcan\nNewton opened up a new field of classical physics. You might pause for a moment and ask yourself: if there is such a thing as classical physics, is there also modern physics? Yes and no. It depends on your perspective. Now, Newton became the benchmark for all new theories and models. Consequently, our observed data became increasingly detailed. We were able to determine the exact orbits of all planets. Everything seems to fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Deviation in Mercury’s orbit. (A) Observed orbit of Mercury, showing the deviation from the theoretical Newtonian model. (B) Model of the hypothetical planet Vulcan, which solved the deviation by pushing Mercury into the correct orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem solved. There was only one small deviation. The orbit of Mercury was slightly off. Specifically, the deviation was 43 arcseconds, or 1.2%, between the observed and calculated orbits using the Newtonian model. Albert Einstein (1879–1955) found this deviation intriguing. His General Theory of Relativity solved this mystery by merging time and space. Before Einstein’s theory was formulated, astronomers suggested the existence of a new planet. They suggested that the deviation would go away if a planet called Vulcan existed and circled the sun in a very narrow orbit. However, this planet was never found.\nAlways remember that models of reality can exist in parallel. Newton’s laws of gravity can be used, even though we know they are wrong and general relativity is less wrong. Why not, right? This is science. We can only reject a model if new observations do not fit into it. Then we must find a new, improved model. However, Newton’s laws are useful in everyday life when we are not moving near the speed of light or relatively to a large mass. In contrast, your GPS only works because we know the General Theory of Relativity. Without this theory, it would not be possible to build and use satellite navigation systems. You can choose your reality and the models you apply.\n\nStill Einstein believed that the solar system was in the middle of the galaxy. And there were no more galaxies than the milky way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: foo (A) foo (B) foo\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the nuclei so small? Considering quantum mechanics, we can only determine exactly the position or the momentum of an object. We see here momentum as speed. Therefore, if we know that the electron is near the nuclei, the speed must be very high. Therefore, the electron can not be very often near the nuclei. Hence, the electron does not fall into it. Due to quantum mechanics, the nuclei has to be so small to have a stable atom.",

Or, at least, that is what we are supposed to think. Knowledge, once formed, tends to become disembodied from its human origins. That is, while knowledge is preserved in the form of books, formulas, proofs, theorems, and such, we must not forget that before all this the formation of knowledge was the result of human thought, effort, and desire. Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears; our emotions are crucial to its development, and its meaning cannot be truly understood if seen as some bloodless and emotionless enterprise.” — Joshua Schimel in Writing Science4\n\nThere are different types of models. In this book we will mainly talk about statistical models, which are a very specific type of mathematical models. There are other models. There are individual models, like models of control. The way in which we understand and experience reality. There are also scientific theories that can be read as umbrellas above a set of models. Theories and models can be viewed as forming a hierarchical structure. Theories are more general, whereas models are very specific. In everyday language, the terms ‘theory’ and ‘model’ are interchangeable.\nAs scientific workers, we work with models on a daily basis. Therefore, this book is about models. Although we may have a theory in the background, our daily life only sporadically touches such high levels.\nReality can be seen through science by carrying out tiny experiments. These experiments are tiny in the sense that reality is overwhelmingly big, so every experiment is tiny in comparison.\nA model is a snapshot out of a bigger theory. Or to have another picture. A theory is a collage of different models. In each theory different models for a given problem exists. Hence, we can use different models in the Newotonian theory, like the formulas for the motion or gravity. Even if the formual ist wrong and a gravity force does not exists in reality.",

This sparked a time of increased scientific research on fleas of all types of hosts, with scientists studying them in great detail. A wealth of research questions remained to be addressed, while funding opportunities lay in wait. We now have the great opportunity to use open-source data to revisit all the exciting findings in flea research. What are our main research topics and questions that we want to cover?\nUnfortunately, none of this ever happened in our branch of reality. But it might happen in countless other branches2.\nQuality Rating (ACR): 1-Bad, 2-Poor, 3-Fair, 4-Good, 5-Excellent.\nHow large is the sample size?",

    "text": "6.1 General background\nLast modified on 25. November 2025 at 20:10:00\nBased on standard methods in flea research and experimental entomology, as well as a similar published experiment, the following three types of food for adult cat fleas are possible, representing different nutritional conditions:\nBlood: This is the natural and optimal food source for adult fleas.Often, defibrinated or anticoagulated animal blood (e.g. bovine blood, rabbit blood) is used for this purpose, which is offered in special in vitro feeding systems (e.g. through a membrane).Expectation: Fleas that are optimally nourished should show the greatest jumping distance.\nSugar water: Often serves as a ‘control feed’ or as a feed that provides energy (sugar) but lacks essential nutrients (such as proteins from blood).Expectation: Jumping distance could be reduced due to the lack of blood and thus the proteins important for reproduction, which could impair physiological fitness.\nKetchup - a nutrient-poor or unsuitable food: This option is used to simulate poor, incomplete or stressful nutritional conditions.In a similar documented experiment, ketchup (a combination of sugar, vinegar and minimal other substances, but no blood) was used as the third feed.Expectation: It can be assumed that fleas will show the shortest jumping distance under these conditions, as they lack both essential nutrients and the necessary energy.",

    "text": "8.2 Theoretical background\n\n8.2.1 Fisher’s approach: The ‘significance test’\nFisher saw statistics as a tool for inductive reasoning (learning from data for science).\n\nOnly ONE hypothesis: There is only the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\) e.g., ‘no effect’). An alternative does not formally exist.\nThe measure (p-value): The p-value is a continuous measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).\n\n\\(p = 0.01\\) Strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\\(p = 0.20\\) No evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nThe result: One rejects the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or one does not make a judgement. One never ‘accepts’ the null hypothesis (one simply has not found enough evidence to reject it).\nObjective: Gain knowledge through individual experiments.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Neyman-Pearson’s approach: The ‘hypothesis test’\nNeyman and Pearson sharply criticised Fisher. They said, ‘You can’t reject anything if you don’t know what to accept instead.’ They saw statistics as a decision-making process (behaviourism).\n\nTWO hypotheses: There is the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) AND a specific alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)).\nType 1 and 2 errors: Before the experiment begins, the following is determined:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) (alpha): How often am I allowed to incorrectly find an effect? (e.g. 5%)\n\\(\\beta\\) (Beta): How often am I allowed to mistakenly overlook a real effect? (Power/test strength).\n\nThe result: A tough decision. ‘Accept \\(H_0\\)’ or ‘Reject \\(H_0\\)’ (or Accept \\(H_A\\)).\nGoal: Minimisation of losses over many repeated experiments (as in industrial production).\n\nNeymans philosophy: We are not looking for the ‘truth’ in individual cases, but rather we behave in such a way that we are wrong as rarely as possible in 1000 decisions.\n\n\n8.2.3 Today’s ‘hybrid chaos’\nModern textbooks and software (such as SPSS or R) often use a hybrid that historically makes no sense:\n\nWe define \\(\\alpha = 5\\%\\) (Neyman-Pearson).\nWe calculate an exact p-value (Fisher).\nWe report the p-value as evidence (Fisher), but use it for a hard yes/no decision (Neyman-Pearson).\nWe talk about ‘power’ (Neyman-Pearson), but often only test against a non-specific alternative.\n\nThis mishmash often leads to misunderstandings, such as that a \\(p = 0.001\\) indicates a ‘stronger effect’ than \\(p = 0.049\\) (Fisher thinking), even though in Neyman-Pearson logic at \\(\\alpha = 5\\%\\) , one would have to make exactly the same decision in both cases (‘Reject \\(H_0\\)’).",

More precisely, in parametric statistics, everything is about a line. In a later chapter, we will also explore nonparametric statistical analysis, which is different but somewhat outdated. We have better tools on your shelves to solve problems that were previously solved using nonparametric approaches.\nBefore we go any deeper into statistics, we need to either learn or review some geometry. We need to understand what a line is and how this concept differs in statistics. I will then explain the geometry of a square and the square root.

    "text": "12.1.1 The square and the root\n\n“What you see, well, you might not know; You get the feelin’, comin’ after the glow” — The joker & the thief by Wolfmother\n\nIf you have never studied statistics before, or have only covered the basics, you may be surprised to learn that everything in statistics revolves around squares. However, this is only true for parametric statistics, which is where we want to start. In the following figure on the left side, you can see a square. A square has the same side length \\(a\\) on all sides, as well as a square area \\(a^2\\). If we want to find the side length of a square and only know its area, we can take the square root \\(\\sqrt{\\phantom{a}}\\) shown on the right side. This is a simple geometry, but an important one to remember. We will need to refer to squares repeatedly throughout this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Visualisation of the relationship between a square and its square root. (A) The square consists of two sides of equal length. Therefore, the area of a square is the square of its side. (B) The square root of the area of a square is the length of its side.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s assume that there are lots of squares. Where these squares originate is not currently important. We have these squares and want to summarise them. A standard statistical procedure is to calculate the area of each square and then add up the areas. We call this new square the sum of squares. The sum of the squares is used so often that it is abbreviated to SS.\nThe following figure shows four squares labelled \\(a_1, ..., a_4\\) on the left. Each square has its own area, labelled \\(a_1^2, ..., a_4^2\\). In order to work with these squares, we will now add up their areas. The sum of the squares is shown on the right. The square root describes the length of the side of the sum of squares. We will use the sum of squares and the square root of the sum of squares repeatedly in our further analysis. They may not appear under the same names, but we will see the squares again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Visualisation of the calculation of the sum of squares. (A) The area of each square is determined. (B) All the areas are then combined to form one large square and then called sum of squares. The square root can then be used for further statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this has not been very complicated. You might already remember the geometry from seeing a square. The tricky part is that we will work with mathematical expressions that are essentially squares, but don’t look like them. Now let’s combine a line with a square. Or answer the question of why a line can be expressed by a square.\n\n\n12.1.2 The line as a square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Visualisation of the dependency between a line and a square. (A) A line through two points, also known as a Euclidean line. Most people think of such a line first when they think about lines through points. This is mathematically correct, but not in statistics. (B) The distance between two points, also known as a line, is represented as a square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.3 The hunter and the rabbit\n\n“Statistics is: When the hunter misses the rabbit once to the left and once to the right, on average the rabbit is dead.” — Mike Krüger, German comedian\n\nI first came across the joke on Tweedback, a tool for anonymous feedback in lectures. One student had written the joke, which intrigued me. At first, I could not understand why. Then I understood the deeper meaning. In statistics, it’s all about lines. Or lines through points. A gunshot is a line. A mean is a line. Single shots deviate from the average shot, as do single observations from the mean. If we measure the distance from the mean to each observation, we will get positive and negative values. Ultimately, these values would sum to zero. I don’t believe for a moment that the comedian truly understands the depth of the joke from a statistical perspective.\nIn the following Figure 12.4, I have illustrated the example with some numbers. The rabbit is sitting at position 5m. The hunter shoots at \\(3m\\), which is \\(-2m\\) to the left. The second shot goes to the right, at \\(7m\\), which is a deviation of \\(+2m\\). We can now calculate the average of the two shots. This is equal to \\(5m\\). The hunter hits. When we calculate the deviation, we get zero: \\((-2) + (+2) = 0\\). Therefore, the whole hunt of two shots has no deviation at all. This is wrong. Our model of reality tells us something completely different compared to what our hunter experienced. Therefore, we need a better model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Illustration of the joke about the hunter and the rabbit. If the hunter shoots past the rabbit on the left and on the right, then on average the hunter will hit the rabbit. The deviation is zero. The joke illustrates the problem of measuring a statistical deviation when positive and negative values can occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Visualisation of the deviation from the hunter and rabbit example. (A) Each deviation is squared. Therefore, no sign is left. (B) The deviations are added up. The square root of the sum of squares has the same unit as the original measurement. The example was built in such a way that the root is the standard deviation.",

    "text": "13.1 What is a model in statistics?\nLast modified on 11. January 2026 at 09:07:20\nImagine you are standing on a globe but still believe it is flat. You are standing on solid ground, with boiling rocks a few kilometers below you. A few kilometers above, you cannot breathe anymore. You are not moving, but the Earth is moving at speeds of up to 828,000 km/h, depending on the reference point. Your reality is a serious misinterpretation.\nI would like to start with a simple example of a statistical model. Perhaps you would like to see a more concrete example of a model. But first, I will show you the most general form of a statistical model. The model is simple and contains only two terms combined with a tilde. The following Figure 13.1 shows how the left-hand side and the right-hand side are connected.\nFigure 13.1: Visualisation of a theoretical statistical model with respect to the programming language R, with the outcome shown on the left-hand side (LHS) and the influencer pictured on the right-hand side (RHS). The two terms are combined by a tilde.\nOn the left-hand side (LHS) we find the outcome. The result of an experiment is called the outcome. The outcome is the measured value. Sometimes, using these words can cause you confusion, but for now we’ll stick to the idea that the result of something is measured in an experiment. We will discover the outcome on the y-axis later on. Therefore, we abbreviate the outcome to Y. On the right side (RHS), you will find the influencer. The influencer is the thing we are trying to change in the experiment. If you change the influencer, the statistical model will show you the change in the outcome. As the change will be on the x-axis, we abbreviate the influencer to X. More often than not, we have one outcome and multiple influencers.\nThe world would be much easier, if there would be only one term for the measures y-values and the influencial values on the x-axis. But this is not true. Each scientific field has its own wording and the wording is changing, if you change the algorithm. So it is a real mess.

These anomalies are usually seen as experimental error, resulting in a social pushback. Eventually, the anomalies pile up, and a crisis occurs. This marks a crack in the stable science. From there, a revolution occurs, and candidates of reality comes into being. Finally, a new paradigm of reality emerges.

    "text": "“I fully agree with you about the significance and educational value of as well as history and philosophy of science. So many people today - and even professional - seem to me like someone who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is - in my opinion - the mark of distinction between a mere craftsman or specialist and a real seeker after truth.” — Albert Einstein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCholera and breathing walls\n\n\n\nIn 1854, cholera visited the city of Munich in Bavaria, Germany. This was not a pleasant visit, as many citizens died of cholera and its consequences. However, not all parts of the city were affected equally. By the end of the 19th century, Munich would become one of the cleanest cities in Europe. Max von Pettenkofer achieved this by building and renovating the canalization system. When cholera arrived, not all parts of the city had equal access to the canalization and fresh water supply. Some parts of the city had easy access to fresh water and working toilets. In other parts of the city, sometimes only divided by a street, construction of the canalization had not yet begun. It was observed that the death toll from cholera varied by district.\nIn the following Figure 1.1 (A) we see a fictional pattern. It is of two districts of Munich. On the left, the sewerage and freshwater systems are already installed and operational. We can call this area the “hygienic area.” On the right, the canalization has not been finished or even started. We will call this area “filthy” or “dirty.” After the cholera epidemic outbreak, the number of deaths in each district was counted. There were ten deaths in the hygienic area and twenty-nine in the filthy area. We assume that both areas have roughly the same number of inhabitants.\nPettenkofer observed the lower death rates in hygienic areas and concluded that canals and fresh water would stop cholera from spreading and killing people. Therefore, more sewage systems must be installed, and the city must be cleaned up. But wait a minute. What is the cause of the deaths? Yes, it is the illness cholera. But how does it work? What causes the illness? Pettenkofer discovered a way to cure or prevent cholera, even though he did not understand the cause of the illness. He did not know how it was transmitted or why people died from it. He proposed that the cause should be found in specific soil and groundwater processes.\nIn 1883, Robert Koch discovered the cholera bacillus to be the cause of the illness. Pettenkofer did not believe in unobservable bacteria. In 1892, at a cholera conference, his belief was so strong that he drank a cholera culture. He survived with mild symptoms. According to Pettenkofer, the cholera culture could not be the reason people died. He was still alive.\nAnother example of Pettenkofer’s thinking is the breathing wall. Figure 1.1 (B) shows the experimental setup. Pettenkofer sealed off his office. He sealed the doors and windows with glue. From his point of view, the room was perfectly contained. Then, he measured the airflow inside the room. The room’s pressure stayed constant while an influx could be measured. Therefore, Pettenkofer concluded that air could pass through the walls’ pores. Thus, the breathing wall model was born. However, it has been suggested that Pettenkofer might have forgotten to seal a chimney, or that the wooden floor and ceiling might have been leaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Visualization of two erroneous theories by Max von Pettenkofer (1818–1901). As a positivist, he only believed in facts that he could see, like the results of experiments. (A) Schematic example of the influence of soil conditions, here represented as fresh water/sewage (blue), on cholera cases. The district with a fresh water supply has fewer cholera cases than the district without access. Pettenkofer was able to contain cholera through hygiene, even if he could not determine its cause. (B) The breathing wall concept, which states that the exchange of fresh air in a room mainly occurs through the walls’ pores. Pettenkofer likely failed to properly seal the chimney and ceilings for the air exchange measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s where we come to a halt. What is Pettenkofer doing? He was a very successful scientist. But he was sometimes wrong. Interestingly, Pettenkofer came up with one of the precursors to the periodic table of elements. He had to stop his work due to a lack of funding from the Bavarian state. In 1869, however, Dmitri Mendeleev, the discoverer of the periodic system, mentioned Pettenkofer in his articles as one of the few who influenced his work. Pettenkofer only looked at what he could see. His thought process was bound to the observable and the instruments he uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Two paths of logic\nLogic is a tool for finding truth. The word “logic” originated from the Greek word logos, meaning “word,” “reason,” or “discourse.” Therefore, logic is essentially the art of making sense. But be careful. Logic is merely a tool and is not the ultimate determiner of truth. Logic is built up in chains of statements. There are two ways to form logical chains: One is from the bottom up, and the other is from the top down. We call the bottom-up approach inductive reasoning and the top-down approach deductive reasoning.\nThe following Figure 1.2 illustrates both logical pathways. On the left is inductive reasoning. We start with an observation, or data, and try to find a pattern in it. These patterns are called laws or models. These patterns can be thought of as mathematical formulas or statements that describe the patterns in the observations. From these patterns, we try to find an overarching theme. This theme is our conclusion or theory. Therefore, we start with specific numbers and spreadsheets and try to derive general rules from them. This is how you do inductive reasoning.\nOn the right, we find deductive reasoning. First, we have a general theory, and then we deduce an experiment from it. In other words, we have a theory and then imagine an experiment to test it. This experiment can be a thought experiment or a physical experiment as large as a particle collider. Based on the results of the experiment, we can then draw conclusions about our theory. Therefore, we can see deductive reasoning as a top-down approach. We start with a general theory and draw more specific conclusions from experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The difference between the two logical pathways: On the left is the inductive logic, which is a bottom-up approach that goes from specific to general. First, we observe and collect data, then we look for patterns in the data. Then, we draw a general conclusion about the pattern. After observing something a few times, we conclude that it is probably a rule. On the right is the deductive logic, a top-down approach from general to specific. We have a general theory and conduct an experiment to test it. Then, we draw a conclusion. From a more common perspective, the two logical pathways have things in common but differ in their train of thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogic is a tool, not a science. This is important for this chapter. We can create any logical chain, but that does not mean the chain contains truth or describes reality. Often, we do not know which reasoning we are applying, but it is usually inductive reasoning. In statistical modeling, we often use inductive reasoning. We start with data and try to find patterns in our observations. Conversely, pure deductive reasoning starts with an assumed truth and moves toward a conclusion. Sometimes, in science, the starting point is pure creative guesswork. Therefore, some scientific approaches use parts of deductive reasoning, but they do not start with a truth; rather, they start with a guess.\nNow, let’s take a closer look at knowledge generation concepts. There are many different ideas out there. Some are outdated, some have had a huge impact, and some have lived on in other philosophies. Most scientists don’t have a philosophy at hand, but they do science. Philosophy is often not taught in schools, so everyone is doing something as long as it works. Therefore, I tried to provide an overview of the most important philosophies that you might follow in part or that might have an impact on this book.\n\n\n1.1.2 Scientific philosophies\nWe will discuss statistical modeling later in this book. Statistical modeling does not come from nowhere; it includes parts of knowledge generation. However, it is susceptible to other philosophies and can be used in different ways. We want to explore these philosophies because they occasionally touch topics related to statistics. Statistics are founded in a historical context, so we will take a closer look at that. In statistics, it is common to observe things and then generate data. Statistics can also be seen as data analysis. Therefore, we start with the observable.\nHow does the human mind learn? How do we gather information? Humans are born in a blank state. No ideas are implanted in the brain; only instincts guide the infant through the first weeks and months. Shortly after, the infant begins to learn through the senses. This is mostly true and forms the basis of empiricism. I will not focus on human development. Therefore, we will only focus on the origin of empiricism as a basis for generating knowledge. The idea of empiricism is simple and appealing. In my experience, common sense often begins with empiricism to gather knowledge. Therefore, we will start with this simple idea and explain its history.\nWe conclude that empiricism is the source of knowledge, and that observation and sensory experience provide that source. We learn through our five senses, which shape our ideas. The focus is on the human mind.\nNext, we will broaden the scope of empiricism by asking how science and society should function. Since we have learned through our senses, we can apply this idea to science and society in general. Since we will focus only on observable things and dismiss invisible entities, we will call our concept positivism. Positivism comes from the Latin word positum, meaning “that which is given” or “laid down.” No, this does not make it any better. Positivism was founded by Auguste Comte (1798-1857) in the early nineteenth century. Comte also favored the idea of the verifiability criterion of meaning. According to this criterion, a statement must be empirically verifiable. We will meet this criterion again soon. Furthermore, we must distinguish between two completely different concepts that often pop up in our minds. Positivism is often confused with positive thinking. This is a common linguistic mistake, but positivism and positive thinking are not related. One is a rigorous philosophy of science, while the other is a psychological mindset or self-help technique.\nIn positivism, we can say that the validity of knowledge comes from observation and sensory experience, but it ignores everything invisible or immeasurable. In other words, if you cannot measure or observe something, it shouldn’t be part of a serious discussion.\nNow, let’s turn the wheel of positivism a bit further towards the extreme. Therefore, we must visit Vienna in the early 19th century. The Vienna Circle was a group of philosophers who met at the University of Vienna from 1924 to 1936. They had a big influence on the study of philosophy and science. In 1929, the Vienna Circle wrote “The Scientific Conception of the World”, also known as “The Manifesto.” The manifesto had two aims. First, it introduces the group and Vienna. At the beginning of the text, it reads more like an advertisement for Vienna and the Vienna Circle. More scientists should join the club. The philosophical main points are somewhat buried in the text. The Vienna Circle proposed that science is both empirical and positivist; knowledge comes only from experience. Furthermore, the process of scientific world conception involves applying logical analysis to observed objects, or, in other words, experience. A statement can only be meaningful if it is testable. This is called the verification principle.\nIn logical positivism, we conclude that knowledge is valid when acquired through sensory experience by integrating modern methods of mathematics and logic. For a statement to be meaningful, it must be testable through observation. It must either be proven true by logic (an analytic statement) or by experimentation (a synthetic statement). Thus, the verification principle is introduced.\nPositivism has a strong influence on the social structures of science and, consequently, on individual scientists. One such scientist was Ernst Mach (1838-1916). Mach greatly impacted the philosophy of knowledge generation with his Machian physics. Machian physics rejects Newtonian theories of space and time, supporting a relative approach to motion instead. Mach’s work inspired Albert Einstein in his search for the theory of general relativity. Machian physics is based entirely on directly observable phenomena. During his lifetime, Mach rejected the existence of atoms. Ultimately, Einstein rejected the positivist aspect of Machian physics, yet many scientists still considered him a positivist. The thinking goes that, since he supported Mach, he also supported the philosophy behind it. Science is always done in a social context.\nThe following figure summaries the three concepts, from empiricism to logical positivism. There is significant overlap between these concepts. However, the concepts become stricter and focus more on science emerging from the individual human in empiricism. We remember that truth comes from observable things and that statements must be verified by tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The intertwining of the three concepts from empiricism to logical positivism. First, there is empiricism, which is based on individual observations and experiences. Positivism attempts to apply this to society and science by disregarding the invisible and immeasurable. Only measurable things should be used in serious scientific discussions. Finally, logical positivism incorporates testable statements and the verification principle into the validity of knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does it matter? From a casual point of view, most parts of positivism makes perfect sense. We see something, come up with an explanation, and test if the explanation is true. This is a very casual concept in science. We are seeker after truth. Later in this book, we will focus on experiments and observations from experiments. These observations are called data. We don’t always need an experiment to gather data; we can also observe nature and draw inferences from it.\nIn our daily scientific work, we produce data that consists of observations. Therefore, we are drawn to the logical positivism approach. It makes sense to believe only in what we can see and disregard everything else.\nHowever, there is a problem. Or to write it in the words of John Passmore, who said: “Logical positivism is dead—or as dead as a philosophical movement can be.” If logical positivism is no longer working, then it never was. Then, we will need a different philosophy on which to base our science. As scientific workers, we could also adopt another philosophy. Statistics is a basket of flowers full of algorithms and models. We can choose from many of them and apply them to data. In this case, the focus is on the algorithm or model. If we only care about them, we follow a different philosophy. Instead of focusing on the observable, we focus on the algorithm that works best as a tool or instrument.\n“Shut up and calculate!”2, it is more or less its origin in the philosophy of instrumentalism. The idea of instrumentalism is not far from logical positivism. Positivism is based on the observable. We only believe in knowledge gathered from visible things. Therefore, we focus on the what. Instrumentalism also looks at things and tries to describe them. Pierre Duhem (1861-1916) first developed the idea of instrumentalism. This philosophy uses mathematical models or logic to predict and explain nature. However, it doesn’t matter if the mathematics describe some type of truth. As long as the mathematics or models work, everything is fine. If there is a deviation, the math can be adapted through knowledge generation. Instrumentalism only focuses on the how and does not ask if there is a theoretical background behind a model as long as the model works. Maybe particles exist or maybe they don’t. Everything is merely a means to make predictions. Even if the model fails, it is only a technical hiccup that must be repaired. A scientific theory is merely a tool that humans use to predict observations in a particular domain of nature by formulating rules. Therefore, instrumentalism is also a prominent form of anti-realism in science. We have useful models that produce successful predictions. We do not need to know whether something like atoms or genes actually exists. A theory can work perfectly well even if it is false. Something is true because it works. In anti-realism, we also focus on what we can measure and use to make predictions. The existence of the moon is irrelevant if there is no one to witness it.\nIn instrumentalism, we conclude that a theory of knowledge should be useful. We use rules as instruments and tools to predict observations. The statements do not need to describe reality or unobservables as long as the rules produce stable success. It’s not worth asking what would happen if nobody was watching.\nAs a statistical worker, the danger of instrumentalism is believing in our models too much. It is to love the process of testing and evaluating models and benchmarks. We find the functional tools, but it doesn’t matter if these tools are based in reality. Statistical models should be useful and work.\nIn 1943, Ayn Rand (1905-1982) introduced objectivism as a philosophy of strong realism and a rejection of mysticism, and all forms of religion. At the heart of her philosophy is the heroic human, capable of anything through the power of the mind. At its core, objectivism is optimistic and guided by reason. Rand chose the name because objectivism is bound to reality. Objects exist independently of consciousness, and knowledge can be attained through inductive logic. Therefore, whether or not something can be measured or observed is irrelevant. The philosophy has a drawback in that it uses a verification principle derived from induction. Therefore, we observe and discover the truth. This is not ideal by any means. Finally, objectivism puts humans at the center, and humans are able to understand reality through reason. As a non-academic, Rand’s philosophy lived a niche existence.\nDo you remember Pettenkofer and his fight against cholera? He focused on observable factors, such as who died and who stayed healthy, and discovered the importance of sanitation. He used the sewage and freshwater systems to cure cholera. Or maybe to just prevent it? Science works. Where is the problem?\nAt this point, we can finally reference a famous saying in statistics: Georg Box said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” I don’t know why, but the saying always annoyed me in a subtle way. Now that I understand the connection between instrumentalism and anti-realism, I know why I dislike them. From my perspective, there is a reality, even if no one is watching. Therefore, not all models can be wrong. The moon exists, and it follows a trajectory described by a formula, or more generally, by a statement or law. The movement does not stop and the moon does not vanish if no one is watching. Therefore, there is a true model of the moon’s movement. This brings us to the final philosophy I would like to introduce. I will address all its problems in the context of statistical modeling for the rest of the book.\nNow we will learn the philosophy of critical realism or critical rationalism. Sometimes, the lines between different philosophies become blurred. Here, we need the core principles of the philosophies, not their minor differences. Critical realism asks: “What must the world be like for science to be possible?” For science to be possible, the world cannot be a collection of random events. Reality must be understandable, orderly, and accessible to the human mind through observation and reason. Science depends on a realistic worldview. We believe that the world is real, not just a dream, but a structured place waiting to be understood. If the world were a chaotic jumble of “useful models,” as instrumentalism suggests, or a series of perceptions, as positivism claims, science would not function as well as it does. We can conduct experiments in a laboratory and apply them to a star millions of miles away. This suggests that there are objective, universal mechanisms at work.\nIn his 1959 book The Logic of Scientific Discovery3, Karl Popper introduced one big idea: The falsification principle states that statements should be falsifiable. Falsifiability was introduced. We will call it falsification in this book. The idea behind the falsification principle is simple. You cannot prove any theory by induction. This is because induction is based on observations. It is impossible to observe all possible instances. A classic example is the idea that all swans are white. It is impossible to observe all swans, so you can never be sure that all swans are truly white. However, if you observe one black swan, you can reject your statement. Again, there is a drawback here. All of our statements or hypotheses must be testable and falsifiable. If our statement cannot be tested, or if no experiment can produce a false result, we cannot make a decision about our statement. Ultimately, falsification means there is no truth in science. Knowledge is not verified. Knowledge grows by proving us wrong, not right. This is an unpleasant idea in common sense. As scientists, we actively try to disprove our theories, searching for the weak points that will break them. In doing so, we hope to find a better explanation or theory.\nThere is one major problem with Popper’s idea of falsification. We could end up with no theory at all. If we reject a hypothesis, statement, or even a whole theory, nothing is left. In his book The beginning of infinity: Explanations that transform the world5, David Deutsch extends Popper’s ideas. Deutsch introduced the good explanation. Science is not only about making predictions, but also about explaining reality. Therefore, reality exists and can be described. A good explanation is “hard-to-vary.” We cannot easily change parts of a theory to fit a particular story which came into our mind. If you can’t imagine an experiment that could prove your theory wrong, then you’re not doing science, you’re telling stories. Consequently, good explanations are easy to falsify. A hard-to-vary explanation makes specific predictions. These predictions are easy to test. Therefore, we use the process of falsification to test our explanations and theories. Unlike Popper, we do not discard a theory that has been partially falsified unless we have a better explanation. We conserve our theories if we do not have a better one. We also want to know why a theory is false. Understanding this is important for developing better theories. In addition, good explanations have a wide reach. We can use them for different objects and implementations. The explanation of Newtonian gravity, for example, has a wide reach. It allows us to calculate the orbits of planets, predict comets, and build bridges. Each scientist’s goal should be to find explanations with a wide reach. For Popper and Deutsch, the falsification principle is the demarcation line of science. With this principle, we can distinguish between science and non-science.\nDeutsch suggests a deductive scientific approach. We should make a bold guess about how reality works. This is the creative aspect of the human mind. Humans are universal explainers, capable of solving any problem with the right knowledge. The guess should be an explanation that is difficult to vary. Then, we design experiments to test the theory under all circumstances. In doing so, we will falsify parts or all of it and learn new things. We will find an intermediate truth as a new starting point for further guessing.\nWhy does Deutsch prefer deductive reasoning over inductive reasoning? First, there is no logical link between something happening before and it happening again. Just because something happened and was observed does not mean that the observation will always occur in the future. Past patterns of observations do not create future laws. Without an explanation of why something happened, the pattern you observe may be misleading. Furthermore, you cannot simply make an observation. Each observation is theory-laden. This is a somewhat cumbersome term that claims you must have an idea about what you want to observe in order to make an observation. This idea of what to observe is a pre-existing theory that allows you to see the data as meaningful. Sometimes the explicit theory is hidden from the scientist.\nIf science operated on an inductive basis, we would be limited by observations and measurements alone. We would not be able to explore the unobservable realms of reality. Knowledge is creative and can therefore explain things we may never see, such as black holes or atoms. We don’t need to see them; we only need a good explanation for them. According to induction, knowledge comes from outside the world. However, Deutsch argues that it is the other way around. According to him, knowledge comes from within the human mind through the process of formulating and falsifying theories.\nFinally, you can forget everything we have learned so far and throw it out the window. Verification, falsification, reach, good explanations, and all the rest are torn down. Follow Paul Karl Feyerabend and his anarchy model from the book Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge1. In short, there is no scientific model. Everything goes. Feyerabend believed that falsification can kill great ideas before they have a chance to flourish. Additionally, many explanations offer more possibilities, providing more room for new thoughts and knowledge generation. Generally, it was the outlaws, such as Galileo, Einstein, and Newton, who brought new ideas and theories into being. Therefore, any structure in science is false. Science is an anachronistic process.\n\n\n1.1.3 Wheel of knowledge\nSo far, we have explored several different scientific philosophies. Besides the question of which philosophy is true—which is a different question altogether—we want to ask: Is there a process in science? Is the generation of knowledge a linear process, a piling up of knowledge, or more of a journey through knowledge?\nIn his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions4, Thomas S. Kuhn proposed a revolutionary idea about how knowledge is generated. Figure 1.4 shows that knowledge generation runs through cycles. There are stable states of science, known as normal science. In this state, scientists solve puzzles and problems within the existing framework of knowledge. These ideas are socially accepted, and fundamental novelties are passively suppressed by the system itself. Everyone is doing their work, and that’s fine. From time to time, however, anomalies in models or observations occur. We see a drift away from stable science. At first, it is a back-and-forth, but as more and more anomalies pile up, it becomes clear that something is going on. These anomalies cannot be explained by experimental errors or noise in the measurements anymore. There is social pushback, but it becomes weaker.\nThen, we observed a crack in the system. A crisis arose. This is the breaking point of the theory. The observed anomalies became so severe that they could no longer be ignored. Tension and frustration spread through the scientific community. Next, new candidates of reality emerge. We see new tools and theories from mostly young scientists who want to start a revolution. Science shifts into a new state of reality, adopting a new language, social structures such as journals and conferences, and a new framework of knowledge. We establish a new paradigm. From there, we enter another stable phase of science. This cycle runs endlessly. We are not just piling up knowledge; it is a process of moving through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The paradigm shift cycle, also known as the Kuhn Cycle after its inventor. The cycle describes how science evolves over time. Normal science is stable and attempts to solve puzzles and problems within a given framework. From time to time, anomalies occur that do not fit the common sense of the current science. These anomalies are usually seen as experimental error, resulting in a social pushback. Eventually, the anomalies pile up, and a crisis occurs. This marks a crack in the stable science. From there, a revolution occurs, and candidates of reality comes into being. Finally, a new paradigm of reality emerges. In this new paradigm, new languages and a new framework of science are established. Then, normal science begins again. There is a strong social component to this cycle because humans often resist fundamental changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the central idea of Kuhn is the paradigm shift. Every science has a paradigm that holds everything together. The social aspect is also important. Science is done by humans within a social structure. Within a paradigm, some thoughts are permitted, while others are considered fundamentally wrong. Therefore, in a stable, normal scientific environment, new fundamental changes do not occur. Scientific careers are shaped by the paradigm, as are funding and resources. If you want to do something new, you will have to face resistance.\nAnother key point of Kuhn’s idea of the paradigm shift is the incommensurability of paradigms. Incommensurability is a difficult word that means something cannot be compared. “Incomparable” is a simpler word that means the same thing. We can compare Newtonian mechanics to Einstein’s general relativity. Both paradigms describe the effects of gravity on bodies in space. However, Newtonian mechanics does not explain why gravity works. Einstein introduced a geometric view of the effects of gravity in four-dimensional space, introducing not only space, but also spacetime. The two theories are incomparable and cannot be used together. Only one can be true. Einstein’s theory produces better predictions in extreme situations and is therefore better. But, returning to Deutsch, Newtonian gravity still works and provides explanations for everyday problems. We can use both.\nSo far, we have not clearly defined what science is. However, in Kuhn’s cycle, there is also a state of pre-science. For humankind, this would be the phase before the Age of Enlightenment (1687–1789), when myths, alchemy, cults, and witchcraft dominated. There were rules of thumb and other farmers’ rules that structured some knowledge. If something worked, it was more or less due to luck. However, even witchcraft has rules and, therefore, a paradigm for working with its statements. Later in this chapter, we will introduce some cults of pseudoscience and their structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteActual crisis\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 What is the replication crisis?\n6\nNot here, move to p-value chapter:7\n\n\n1.1.5 Particle model\n8\n\n\n1.1.6 Dark matter\nhttps://youtu.be/BHAOsbzaat0?si=BmRJ_dbdjMczKiUQ\n\n\n\nOkay, this sounds very theoretical. But what is science, and how do we do it? I see your point. Now, we will take a step further and find out what the three pillars of scientific research are. Then, we will determine in which pillar your daily scientific work mostly falls. Then, we will talk about science and how to practice it. I know it’s a long journey.\n\n\n1.1.7 The three pillars of scientific research\nEveryone likes pillars, so we have three pillars of scientific research. The first is theoretical science, the second is experimental science, and the third is instrumental science. All three types are more or less interconnected. Don’t ask me how the pillars can be interconnected, but sometimes pictures are misleading. Figure 1.5 shows the interaction between the three fields.\nSo far, we have mainly discussed theoretical science and its underlying philosophy. Theoretical science is the brain of knowledge generation. We conduct thought experiments and generate ideas. We also produce new algorithms, mathematical tools, and conceptual models. However, we don’t build or test anything in the physical realm. Therefore, theoretical science suggests experiments for experimental science and provides blueprints for instrumental science to test and build.\nExperimental science is the daily work of most scientists. We gather empirical data and test models and theories. Often, the work is much smaller in scale, and theories are not touched. Our goal is to observe effects or differences between groups, predict outcomes, and explain systems by identifying patterns in data. Therefore, we need the support of instrumental science if we want to observe new parts of reality that were not technically available until now. We often use devices that have already been built.\nInstrumental science is the driving force. There, we produce new machines with better sensors that can observe things that were previously unobservable. We use the ideas and blueprints of theoretical science to build machinery. However, the daily work of scientists involves the small parts and technical implementation. Our goal is to produce new, more precise, or more efficient devices than those already in existence. Sometimes, we need smaller or more reliable machines to conduct better experiments and prove theories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The three types of science working fields are as follows: Theoretical science is the brain of science, where new, fundamental concepts are born. Thought experiments and guesswork are the main tasks. Experimental science uses suggestions from theory to conduct tests. This testing is based on the falsification principle. Finally, instrumental science uses blueprints from theory to invent new devices usable in experimental science. Each type of science can be done without using the other fields. It can be done in a passive manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental and instrumental science are less influenced by philosophy than theoretical science. Experimental and instrumental science is essentially the working force of science. They would have nothing to do without an overarching theoretical idea of how instruments should be built and experiments carried out. The theory determines how an experiment must be designed to be testable and falsifiable. This gives us an idea of which instruments we need and how we can build them. On the other hand, we discover interesting anomalies when we build things. Things that should theoretically work do not. Solving such anomalies in the building process can generate new ideas about why things happen. Therefore, all three pillars require a constant flow of ideas and interconnection.",

The more I researched, the more complicated the answer became. Or the other way around. I followed the advice of Wolfgang Pauli.

However, science also has objective aspects that I want to present here. Ultimately, decide for yourself what science truly is.\nThe following Figure 1.6 shows the demarcation line between science and non-science. In the next sections, we will discuss each specific part, but I think it’s important to start with a clear overview. Science is distinguished from non-science through experimentation and falsification. This is true in this book. There are many subtle definitions, but I will keep it simple here. If an experiment is not possible, then it is not science. We also need the ability to build a falsification framework. Therefore, we need hypotheses that can be rejected by experimentation. These two requirements are met by the natural sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology, in order of their purity. Biology includes medicine and all other fields of knowledge gathered from living things. In addition to natural science, there is formal science, which can be seen as a tool of science. This is due to the lack of experimentation, falsification, or both. Therefore, we will not include mathematics, logic, or theoretical computer science as sciences. True non-science fields are intuition-based or subjective at their core. There are many of these fields, and we will discuss them shortly. The humanities are undoubtedly different from non-science, but this book is not about the humanities, so we will put them aside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Visualization of the demarcation line of science. This line divides science from non-science through experimentation and the principle of falsification. The purity of science fields is taken from xkcd comic #435 (https://xkcd.com/435). According to this definition, natural science, including physics, chemistry, and biology, is separated from formal science, including mathematics. Formal science must be clearly distinguished from other intuition-based and subjective non-science, such as pseudoscience or anti-science. The humanities are indisputably different but are also considered non-science in this schematic.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps we should start with the supposedly easy part. What is the opposite of science? In doing so, we will gain an understanding of the term “science” and what it means to us. This may be the deepest lesson for me: we cannot really grasp science. Science is connected to each person in a different emotional way. Science seems cold and rational, but humans are not. Therefore, our relationship with science is strange and complex. Science is its own way of thinking, perhaps a philosophy. Therefore, there are as many ways of thinking as there are human minds.\n\n1.2.1 The opposite of science\nAs I found out, there is no direct opposite of science. That’s interesting. Sometimes, you can define something by knowing what it is not. You might think this is not so problematic. Take a few minutes to ask yourself: “What is the opposite of science?” Okay, good to have your focus back on the page. Maybe you thought science was cold and rational. I will share my personal story with science. For me, science was Star Trek: Enterprise. But I’m too young for Kirk and Spock. So, I was socialized with Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). That’s where I first encountered Shakespeare, but that’s another story. In TNG, science was determined by the exploration of new worlds. I would sit comfortably on the open bridge in front of the gigantic viewscreen. Commander Data was the embodiment of science. He was an android. He was rational and cold, devoid of emotion and humor. Let’s flip these attributes.\nIf an android is science, then what is a human? Then is the human the opposite of science? Perhaps there is some truth to that. Humans have lived on this planet for thousands of years, but science as we know it began during the Enlightenment. So perhaps humans are the opposite of science. Human beings are full of emotions and feelings. Each one is very subjective and interested in their own development. They feel love and romance. Neither of these is very scientific. Humans also believe. Some believe in a more structured manner, like in big churches, while others believe in a more individual manner. However, believing in something has nothing to do with science. But humans do science. Therefore, science is part of humanity. As Joshua Schimel said, “Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears. Our emotions are crucial to its development, and it cannot be truly understood as some bloodless, emotionless enterprise.”6 Science is a human endeavor.\nAccording to Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”7 Is magic therefore the opposite of science? We cannot perform magic. We do not have the power to do so. However, some humans believe that we can perform magic. Who is “we”? The advanced part of humankind. We come into contact with our brothers and sisters who are at a different technological level, such as tribal cultures on isolated islands in Indonesia. To a tribe with a primitive culture, our technology seems like magic. Here, we can observe the cargo cult. A cargo cult is named after its appearance in World War II. The US Army faced the challenge of determining the best island-hopping route to mainland Japan. Since no one knew and the tides of war were constantly changing, the US Army Logistics Corps decided to drop cargo everywhere. This way, if US soldiers approached an island, there would already be plenty of supplies.\nWhat happened to the indigenous population? They believed that the gods had come to bring them cargo. They could not think of any other explanation for what they observed. They observed hardened silver birds dropping and landing on the islands. After a while, the gods stopped showing up. The war was over. But nobody told them. Therefore, the people of the islands copied the gods’ behavior. They built the control room, and they made a radar station out of grass and wood. They even built plans out of grass. Nothing could work. They did everything perfectly, but they missed the point entirely. It was a cargo cult, not science. They copied someone else’s routine and hoped to experience what the gods experienced when they did the same.\nDo you follow a cargo cult in your daily routines? Do you do things that you have seen but don’t understand? Do you believe that they will work even though you don’t know why? This is totally human and from my point of view totally necessary to be a working community member. Some stuff must be done, even if I don not really understand the why. But what if we do it in science? Then we will do cargo cult science8. It is a danger of enormous proportions if done in the wrong place with the wrong intentions. Still, most intentions are good and are twisted by the circumstances. There are several examples of following dogmatic rules and getting a catastrophic outcome. Later, we will explore different models of reality, including the Fukushima nuclear accident.\nFor now, I would like to conclude that the opposite of science is difficult to grasp. On the one hand, we could argue that human emotions and feelings are the opposite of cold, rational science. However, emotions are also the driving force behind human scientific inquiry. Therefore, we are doing something scientific by leaving the topic open for further research and looking for things that are not science.\n\n\n1.2.2 Pseudoscience as a chimera\nBesides things that are the opposite of science, there are things that are similar to science or that use attributes and tools in a distorted way to imitate science. Conspiracy theories9,10 look like science and use science terms and tools. They play on a stage that looks like science but has no deeper foundation. It’s more like a nice story about humans harming other humans. However, conspiracy theories attempt to explain the world and often generate money for the storyteller. Therefore, I do not see conspiracy theories as the opposite of science. These conspiracy theories are non-science. Some theories have a historical basis, such as the hollow earth conspiracy theory. We will discuss the origin later. Conspiracy theories like to be retold, and in the process, they grow and multiply. To circumvent the proliferation of conspiracy theories, I will provide an illustration of the anti-conspiracy theory “Birds Aren’t Real” by Peter McIndoe.\nWhat does the movement claim? In short, the US government kills all birds in the US and replaces them with bird-looking drones. Birds sit on power lines to recharge and defecate on cars to mark them visually. The bird drones are there to spy on American citizens. The specifications are inconsistent and vary. This is a typical sign of a conspiracy theory. Finally, U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the government due to his reluctance to kill all the birds as cherry on top.\nWhat do conspiracy theories have in common? They all tell a good story. I personally find them more similar to fairy tales, with the standard Greek dramatic structure of one hero against an anonymous horde of evil. In addition, they all have in common a lack of experiment. They don’t even conduct a small experiment or propose a hypothesis to test. A testable hypothesis is rarely claimed. Even if a hypothesis is present, the story can easily be changed to maintain its purpose: to tell a good story. Here, we will not focus on conspiracy theories and how they work. This topic is beyond the scope of this book.\nThere is another field in which personal stories are the focus. Psychoanalysis uses direct dialogue between two people to help one of them. In psychoanalysis, there are also no experiments. History knows of long debates about whether psychoanalysis is a science or not, or to what extent. Psychoanalysis shares a similar fate to the Humanities in general. They are not considered science in the scope of this book either. Just because something is not a science does not make it bad. Many important things in life have nothing to do with science.\n\n\n1.2.3 An approach to real science\nI have discussed what the opposite of science could be. We have thought about what science not to meant. Know I want to make a little bit more clear, what science supposedly is. We divide science into two parts. The natural sciences, which include beside others physics, chemistry and biology. With biology we include all the life sciences. The other part is the formal science. We see here the formal science as tools to do science. As formal science we have as the main fields the mathematics, logic and theoretical computer science.\nExperimentation and falsification lie at the core of science. We cannot reject an experiment. An experiment either takes place or it does not. However, a testable hypothesis can be rejected. This is sometimes referred to as the demarcation line of science, which is used to determine whether a field belongs to the natural sciences. In this book, we will use formal science to study the natural sciences. We need formal science as a tool.\nMeters of books have been written about the sciences. As at the beginning stated, there are different version and definitions. While I was writing what you are now reading, I found some literature I party read and find intriguing. We meet Karl Pearson again as a founder of statistics, but in 1892 he wrote the book “The grammar of science”11, which also inspired Einstein on his way to relativity.\nCan science be objective? “Science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind. […] In truth, the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.”\n“The classification of facts, the recognition of their sequence and relative significance is the function of science, and the habit of forming a judgment upon these facts unbiased by personal feeling is characteristic of what may be termed the scientific frame of mind.” Karl\nErsnt Mach (1838-1916) “Ernst Mach’s positivism is a subjective, anti-metaphysical philosophy of science that restricts legitimate knowledge exclusively to directly observable sensations and measurements. He rejected unobservable entities like atoms as”hypothetical fictions”,”\n12 What is this thing called Science?\n“In the same way, it is possible to follow form and call it science, but that is pseudo-science.”\n“It should not be”science has shown” but “this experiment, this effect, has shown.”\n“the result of the discovery that it is worthwhile rechecking by new direct experience, and not necessarily trusting the [human] race[’s] experience from the past.”\n13 What is science\n14 What is science?\nDavid Deutsch claimed that science is guessing and falsification. Or in his words, “Tte whole [scientific] process resembles biological evolution. A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche.”5\nWe conclude the following: A hypothesis should be testable through experimentation. The experiment should be designed in such a way that the hypothesis can be rejected. We need falsification. The experiment should also be reproducible; we will come to this point later.\n\n\n1.2.4 Get science done\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: The wheel of knowledge combines science (the why), data (the what), and models (the how) in a framework. In an ideal world, all three would be active in generating knowledge. However, at least two must be chosen. Combining science and data is done in exploratory data analysis, where storytelling and visualization guide the explanation. The combination of science and models is used in theoretical works, such as general and special relativity. At its core, it is a thought experiment that generates laws and models. Most likely, data is combined with a model. The models reveal patterns in the data. These models can be used for prediction and inference. For example, standard quantum mechanics can be used as a powerful tool even though the reality of atoms, which the models predict, is unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom now on I had to do a harsh decision. Science is broad, this book is in contrast slim. Therefore I will focus on the natural science. Especially, the life science, which includes all living things. Yes, some parts will also applicable to more technical fields like mechanical engineering and engineering sciences but only in a limited way.

Doing so sparks creativity.\nOtto Kruse stated in his book, “many scientific topics can only be solved once all aspects have been explicitly formulated.

I don’t remember everything, but one quote from the beginning of the lecture has stuck with me: “Statistics is the engine room of science.” I think this quote might not have been spoken in this form. Rather, it was the underlying theme of the lecture.\nA toolbox of mathematical models to do science.\nIn this book we will use Fisherian statistics, which is inductive logic reasoning. Or in other words the logic of inductive inference.\nFisher switched from a mathematical deductive reasoning to a inductive reasoning in science. This is remarkable for me, because he changed the way he does science.\nStatistics by Fisher and quantum mechanics have in common that both do inductive probabilistic reasoning. Scientific models are deductive\nStatistical models are inductive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Inductive reasoning is a probabilistic process in statistics. First, a hypothesis is stated. Then, an experiment is conducted based on the hypothesis, and data is collected. This data is a random representation of observables. This is where the probabilistic process begins. Then, statistical modeling is applied to the experimental data to minimize noise. Finally, a conclusion is drawn. Sometimes the aim is to make a probabilistic decision or explanation, with or without prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDerivation of the formula for kinetic energy\n\n\n\nInductive reasoning seems a bit difficult to follow. Therefore, I conducted a small experiment to derive the formula for an object’s genetic energy, focusing on velocity. To make things easier, we will keep the mass constant. The formula is well-known; Newton discovered it. The formula for kinetic energy is \\(E_{kinetic} = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\). Therefore, we will take the mass of an object in kilograms and multiply it by the square of the velocity. Velocity is defined as follows: \\(v = \\tfrac{d}{t}\\). We divide the distance traveled by the time it takes the object to travel that distance. Now, I want to find the dependency between velocity and kinetic energy. To do so, I built the following apparatus. A \\(30\\)-gram (\\(0.03kg\\)) ball lies on a height-adjustable tower. The ball will travel a ramp without friction, covering a distance of \\(60cm\\) (\\(0.6m\\)) to the ground. At different heights, we will measure how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. Then, we can calculate the velocity in each trial. We know the ball’s energy at the top. At the top, we find the potential energy with \\(E_{potential} = mgh\\). We will multiply the ball’s mass by the acceleration due to gravity, which is \\(9.81 m/s^2\\), and the height of the tower. Since we are changing the height, the ball’s energy will also increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: The formula for kinetic energy can be derived through the following example experiment. A ball of fixed mass rolls down a fixed ramp from different heights. For each trial, the time it takes the ball to reach the bottom is measured with a stopwatch. The velocity can be calculated from the traveled distance and time. As the height increases, the ball will reach the ground in less time. Friction can be ignored. However, a measurement error will most likely occur in each trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s write everything down. We have the mass of the ball, \\(m = 0.03kg\\), the length of the ramp, \\(d = 2m\\), and the acceleration due to gravity, \\(g = 9.81 m/s^2\\). We put the tower at five different heights and let the ball roll. The ball runs surprisingly fast. Because we cannot perfectly adjust the height, and manual time measurement is error-prone, we obtain noisy velocity measurements. The observed data has an error. The table Table 1.1 includes the measured and calculated data.\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Results table from the experiment to determine the formula for kinetic energy. The height was changed five times. Using the acceleration due to gravity, the potential energy of the ball can be determined from its height and fixed weight. The ball’s speed can be determined from the rolling time and the fixed ramp length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight [m]\nPotential energy [J]\nTime [s]\nVelocity [m/s]\n\n\n\n\n\\(0.1\\)\n\\(0.1 \\cdot 0.03 \\cdot 9.81 = 0.029\\)\n\\(1.58\\)\n\\(2/1.58 = 1.27\\)\n\n\n\\(0.2\\)\n\\(0.059\\)\n\\(0.95\\)\n\\(2.11\\)\n\n\n\\(0.3\\)\n\\(0.088\\)\n\\(0.85\\)\n\\(2.36\\)\n\n\n\\(0.4\\)\n\\(0.118\\)\n\\(0.65\\)\n\\(3.09\\)\n\n\n\\(0.5\\)\n\\(0.147\\)\n\\(0.72\\)\n\\(2.78\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA table of data is nice, but most of us cannot really see anything in a table. Therefore, we will visualize our data throughout the book. The Figure 1.10 displays the five data points for the energy of the balls and the final velocity. The blue line shows the result of a statistical model. I ran a nonlinear regression to find the perfect line through the points. How did I do this? We will discuss modeling later in the book. In contrast, the purple line shows the actual dependency of velocity on energy. There is a deviation in our statistical model. We can visualize this deviation as an area of uncertainty in our plot. Due to this deviation, we cannot find the perfect formula. There are different ways to show statistical deviation. In general, the deviation is related to how far the individual observations or points are from the line drawn by the model. This process is called fitting a line through points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Visualization of the relationship between energy and velocity. The points represent calculated velocities from different heights. Due to measurement errors, the points do not fit perfectly on a line. The blue line is the formula derived from the data using a nonlinear model. The shaded area shows the uncertainty caused by measurement errors. The purple line shows the true dependency using the formula for kinetic energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from our small experiment? No matter what we do, there will always be an error, noise, or deviation. There are different names for nearly identical concepts. This is the core of inductive reasoning using statistics. We will always have errors, and we want to minimize them. The main topic of this book is what this error is and how we describe these errors. Not really the errors themselves, but rather the concept of drawing lines through points by minimizing error.\n\n\nRandomization and random observations",

    "section": "1.2 Typology of science",
    "text": "1.2 Typology of science\nNow, we can shift our focus to the practical considerations of how we want to conduct our research. We have already discussed the theoretical background. However, the topology of science is still open to debate. What is science? What types of science are there? What is the opposite of science? These are all questions I like to consider. Next, we will discuss how to do science. One topic I will leave open is the reason why we do science. I assume that you are interested in science or feel the need to do it. You will do science regardless of the arguments. Then, let’s start with the distinction between science and non-science.\nThe following Figure 1.6 shows the demarcation line between science and non-science. In the next sections, we will discuss each specific part, but I think it’s important to start with a clear overview. Science is distinguished from non-science through experimentation and falsification. This is true in this book. There are many subtle definitions, but I will keep it simple here. If an experiment is not possible, then it is not science. We also need the ability to build a falsification framework. Therefore, we need hypotheses that can be rejected by experimentation. These two requirements are met by the natural sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology, in order of their purity. Biology includes medicine and all other fields of knowledge gathered from living things. In addition to natural science, there is formal science, which can be seen as a tool of science. This is due to the lack of experimentation, falsification, or both. Therefore, we will not include mathematics, logic, or theoretical computer science as sciences. True non-science fields are intuition-based or subjective at their core. There are many of these fields, and we will discuss them shortly. The humanities are undoubtedly different from non-science, but this book is not about the humanities, so we will put them aside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Visualization of the demarcation line of science. This line divides science from non-science through experimentation and the principle of falsification. The purity of science fields is taken from xkcd comic #435 (https://xkcd.com/435). According to this definition, natural science, including physics, chemistry, and biology, is separated from formal science, including mathematics. Formal science must be clearly distinguished from other intuition-based and subjective non-science, such as pseudoscience or anti-science. The humanities are indisputably different but are also considered non-science in this schematic.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps we should start with the supposedly easy part. What is the opposite of science? In doing so, we will gain an understanding of the term “science” and what it means to us. This may be the deepest lesson for me: we cannot really grasp science. Science is connected to each person in a different emotional way. Science seems cold and rational, but humans are not. Therefore, our relationship with science is strange and complex. Science is its own way of thinking, perhaps a philosophy. Therefore, there are as many ways of thinking as there are human minds.\n\n1.2.1 The opposite of science\nAs I found out, there is no direct opposite of science. That’s interesting. Sometimes, you can define something by knowing what it is not. You might think this is not so problematic. Take a few minutes to ask yourself: “What is the opposite of science?” Okay, good to have your focus back on the page. Maybe you thought science was cold and rational. I will share my personal story with science. For me, science was Star Trek: Enterprise. But I’m too young for Kirk and Spock. So, I was socialized with Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). That’s where I first encountered Shakespeare, but that’s another story. In TNG, science was determined by the exploration of new worlds. I would sit comfortably on the open bridge in front of the gigantic viewscreen. Commander Data was the embodiment of science. He was an android. He was rational and cold, devoid of emotion and humor. Let’s flip these attributes.\nIf an android is science, then what is a human? Then is the human the opposite of science? Perhaps there is some truth to that. Humans have lived on this planet for thousands of years, but science as we know it began during the Enlightenment. So perhaps humans are the opposite of science. Human beings are full of emotions and feelings. Each one is very subjective and interested in their own development. They feel love and romance. Neither of these is very scientific. Humans also believe. Some believe in a more structured manner, like in big churches, while others believe in a more individual manner. However, believing in something has nothing to do with science. But humans do science. Therefore, science is part of humanity. As Joshua Schimel said, “Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears. Our emotions are crucial to its development, and it cannot be truly understood as some bloodless, emotionless enterprise.”9 Science is a human endeavor.\nAccording to Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”10 Is magic therefore the opposite of science? We cannot perform magic. We do not have the power to do so. However, some humans believe that we can perform magic. Who is “we”? The advanced part of humankind. We come into contact with our brothers and sisters who are at a different technological level, such as tribal cultures on isolated islands in Indonesia. To a tribe with a primitive culture, our technology seems like magic. Here, we can observe the cargo cult. A cargo cult is named after its appearance in World War II. The US Army faced the challenge of determining the best island-hopping route to mainland Japan. Since no one knew and the tides of war were constantly changing, the US Army Logistics Corps decided to drop cargo everywhere. This way, if US soldiers approached an island, there would already be plenty of supplies.\nWhat happened to the indigenous population? They believed that the gods had come to bring them cargo. They could not think of any other explanation for what they observed. They observed hardened silver birds dropping and landing on the islands. After a while, the gods stopped showing up. The war was over. But nobody told them. Therefore, the people of the islands copied the gods’ behavior. They built the control room, and they made a radar station out of grass and wood. They even built plans out of grass. Nothing could work. They did everything perfectly, but they missed the point entirely. It was a cargo cult, not science. They copied someone else’s routine and hoped to experience what the gods experienced when they did the same.\nDo you follow a cargo cult in your daily routines? Do you do things that you have seen but don’t understand? Do you believe that they will work even though you don’t know why? This is totally human and from my point of view totally necessary to be a working community member. Some stuff must be done, even if I don not really understand the why. But what if we do it in science? Then we will do cargo cult science11. It is a danger of enormous proportions if done in the wrong place with the wrong intentions. Still, most intentions are good and are twisted by the circumstances. There are several examples of following dogmatic rules and getting a catastrophic outcome. Later, we will explore different models of reality, including the Fukushima nuclear accident.\nFor now, I would like to conclude that the opposite of science is difficult to grasp. On the one hand, we could argue that human emotions and feelings are the opposite of cold, rational science. However, emotions are also the driving force behind human scientific inquiry. Therefore, we are doing something scientific by leaving the topic open for further research and looking for things that are not science.\n\n\n1.2.2 Pseudoscience as a chimera\nBesides things that are the opposite of science, there are things that are similar to science or that use attributes and tools in a distorted way to imitate science. Conspiracy theories12,13 look like science and use science terms and tools. They play on a stage that looks like science but has no deeper foundation. It’s more like a nice story about humans harming other humans. However, conspiracy theories attempt to explain the world and often generate money for the storyteller. Therefore, I do not see conspiracy theories as the opposite of science. These conspiracy theories are non-science. Some theories have a historical basis, such as the hollow earth conspiracy theory. We will discuss the origin later. Conspiracy theories like to be retold, and in the process, they grow and multiply. To circumvent the proliferation of conspiracy theories, I will provide an illustration of the anti-conspiracy theory “Birds Aren’t Real” by Peter McIndoe.\nWhat does the movement claim? In short, the US government kills all birds in the US and replaces them with bird-looking drones. Birds sit on power lines to recharge and defecate on cars to mark them visually. The bird drones are there to spy on American citizens. The specifications are inconsistent and vary. This is a typical sign of a conspiracy theory. Finally, U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the government due to his reluctance to kill all the birds as cherry on top.\nWhat do conspiracy theories have in common? They all tell a good story. I personally find them more similar to fairy tales, with the standard Greek dramatic structure of one hero against an anonymous horde of evil. In addition, they all have in common a lack of experiment. They don’t even conduct a small experiment or propose a hypothesis to test. A testable hypothesis is rarely claimed. Even if a hypothesis is present, the story can easily be changed to maintain its purpose: to tell a good story. Here, we will not focus on conspiracy theories and how they work.

Psychoanalysis shares a similar fate to the Humanities in general. They are not considered science in the scope of this book either. Just because something is not a science does not make it bad. Many important things in life have nothing to do with science.\n\n\n1.2.3 An approach to “real” science\nSo far, I have discussed the opposites of science and pseudoscience. We have considered what science is not. However, I must be careful because, as Paul Feyerabend correctly stated, science should be anti-dogma. Therefore, science is a beautiful, messy, human adventure that cannot be put in a box or a closed framework. Perhaps he is right, yet I will do my best to achieve this goal for the book you are reading. Ultimately, you are free to choose your own worldview and science.\nKnow I want to make a little bit more clear, what science supposedly is. In Figure 1.6 we divide science into two parts. The natural sciences, which include beside others physics, chemistry and biology. With biology we include all the life sciences. The other part is the formal science. We see here the formal science as tools to do science. As formal science we have as the main fields the mathematics, logic and theoretical computer science.\nExperimentation and falsification lie at the core of science. We cannot reject an experiment. An experiment either takes place or it does not. However, a testable hypothesis can be rejected. This is sometimes referred to as the demarcation line of science, which is used to determine whether a field belongs to the natural sciences.

Therefore, I conducted a small experiment to derive the formula for an object’s genetic energy, focusing on velocity. To make things easier, we will keep the mass constant. The formula is well-known; Newton discovered it. The formula for kinetic energy is \\(E_{kinetic} = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\). Therefore, we will take the mass of an object in kilograms and multiply it by the square of the velocity. Velocity is defined as follows: \\(v = \\tfrac{d}{t}\\). We divide the distance traveled by the time it takes the object to travel that distance. Now, I want to find the dependency between velocity and kinetic energy. To do so, I built the following apparatus. A \\(30\\)-gram (\\(0.03kg\\)) ball lies on a height-adjustable tower. The ball will travel a ramp without friction, covering a distance of \\(60cm\\) (\\(0.6m\\)) to the ground. At different heights, we will measure how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. Then, we can calculate the velocity in each trial. We know the ball’s energy at the top. At the top, we find the potential energy with \\(E_{potential} = mgh\\). We will multiply the ball’s mass by the acceleration due to gravity, which is \\(9.81 m/s^2\\), and the height of the tower. Since we are changing the height, the ball’s energy will also increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: The formula for kinetic energy can be derived through the following example experiment. A ball of fixed mass rolls down a fixed ramp from different heights. For each trial, the time it takes the ball to reach the bottom is measured with a stopwatch. The velocity can be calculated from the traveled distance and time. As the height increases, the ball will reach the ground in less time. Friction can be ignored. However, a measurement error will most likely occur in each trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s write everything down. We have the mass of the ball, \\(m = 0.03kg\\), the length of the ramp, \\(d = 2m\\), and the acceleration due to gravity, \\(g = 9.81 m/s^2\\). We put the tower at five different heights and let the ball roll. The ball runs surprisingly fast. Because we cannot perfectly adjust the height, and manual time measurement is error-prone, we obtain noisy velocity measurements. The observed data has an error.

Rather, it was the underlying theme of the lecture.\nA toolbox of mathematical models to do science.\nIn this book we will use Fisherian statistics, which is inductive logic reasoning.
