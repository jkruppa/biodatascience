The first chapter of this book is already the hardest. I started writing this chapter very early on, perhaps even before any of the others. Yet it took the longest to finish. The question is simple: What is science? The more I researched, the more complicated the answer became. Or the other way around. I followed the advice of Wolfgang Pauli. Pauli defined the scientific method as "taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results." Therefore, I tried to read and find answers to the question of what science might be. Perhaps science is, at its core, something personal. However, science also has objective aspects that I want to present here. Ultimately, decide for yourself what science truly is.

The purity of science fields is taken from xkcd comic #435 ([https://xkcd.com/435](https://xkcd.com/435/)). According to this definition, natural science, including physics, chemistry, and biology, is separated from formal science, including mathematics. Formal science must be clearly distinguished from other intuition-based and subjective non-science, such as pseudoscience or anti-science. The humanities are indisputably different but are also considered non-science in this schematic."

## What is not science?

Mathematics and psychoanalysis have no experiments.

Mathematics and logic are more like scientific tools to do science.



## What is the opposite of science?


As I found out, there is no direct opposite of science. Which is interesting. Because sometimes you can define something by knowing what the think is not. Is mathematics the language of nature?

Cargo cult science

## Why do science?


## How to do science?

"As a scientist, you are a professional writer," Joshua Schimel said. @schimel2012writing

Pauli defined the scientific method as "taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results." @fischer2022stunde. This is more or less about taking a chair and sitting in the middle of the room and getting bored as long as possible. Doing so sparks creativity.

> *"Many scientific topics can only be solved once all aspects have been explicitly formulated. The mind is not sufficiently prepared for this, as it can only ever focus on small sections at a time. Systematic thinking is only possible when writing, i.e. recording the results of one's thinking and relating them to other aspects." --- Otto Kruse @kruse2007keine*

## What is statistics?

A toolbox of mathematical models to do science.

In this book we will use Fisherian statistics, which is inductive logic reasoning. Or in other words the logic of inductive inference.
 
Fisher switched from a mathematical deductive reasoning to a inductive reasoning in science. This is remarkable for me, because he changed the way he does science. 
 
Statistics by Fisher and quantum mechanics have in common that both do inductive probabilistic reasoning. 
Scientific models are deductive

Statistical models are inductive

First, we observe and collect data, then we look for patterns in the data. Then, we draw a general conclusion about the pattern. After observing something a few times, we conclude that it is probably a rule. On the right is the deductive logic, a top-down approach from general to specific. We have a general theory and conduct an experiment to test it. Then, we draw a conclusion. From a more common perspective, the two logical pathways have things in common but differ in their train of thought."

Science is guessing and falsification
