After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\" --- Morpheus, Matrix*\n\nThe first chapter of this book is already the hardest. I started writing this chapter very early on, perhaps even before any of the others. Yet it took the longest to finish. The question is simple: What is science? The more I researched, the more complicated the answer became. Or the other way around. I followed the advice of Wolfgang Pauli. Pauli defined the scientific method as \"taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.\" Therefore, I tried to read and find answers to the question of what science might be. Perhaps science is, at its core, something personal. However, science also has objective aspects that I want to present here. Ultimately, decide for yourself what science truly is.\n\nThe following @fig-overview-sience-non-science shows the demarcation line between science and non-science. In the next sections, we will discuss each specific part, but I think it's important to start with a clear overview. Science is distinguished from non-science through experimentation and falsification. This is true in this book. There are many subtle definitions, but I will keep it simple here. If an experiment is not possible, then it is not science. We also need the ability to build a falsification framework. Therefore, we need hypotheses that can be rejected by experimentation. These two requirements are met by the natural sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology, in order of their purity. Biology includes medicine and all other fields of knowledge gathered from living things. In addition to natural science, there is formal science, which can be seen as a tool of science. This is due to the lack of experimentation, falsification, or both. Therefore, we will not include mathematics, logic, or theoretical computer science as sciences. True non-science fields are intuition-based or subjective at their core. There are many of these fields, and we will discuss them shortly. The humanities are undoubtedly different from non-science, but this book is not about the humanities, so we will put them aside.        \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visualization of the demarcation line of science. This line divides science from non-science through experimentation and the principle of falsification. The purity of science fields is taken from xkcd comic #435 ([https://xkcd.com/435](https://xkcd.com/435/)). According to this definition, natural science, including physics, chemistry, and biology, is separated from formal science, including mathematics. Formal science must be clearly distinguished from other intuition-based and subjective non-science, such as pseudoscience or anti-science. The humanities are indisputably different but are also considered non-science in this schematic.](chapter-01-what-is-science_files/figure-html/fig-overview-sience-non-science-1.png){#fig-overview-sience-non-science fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPerhaps we should start with the supposedly easy part. What is the opposite of science? In doing so, we will gain an understanding of the term \"science\" and what it means to us. This may be the deepest lesson for me: we cannot really grasp science. Science is connected to each person in a different emotional way. Science seems cold and rational, but humans are not. Therefore, our relationship with science is strange and complex. Science is its own way of thinking, perhaps a philosophy. Therefore, there are as many ways of thinking as there are human minds.\n\n## What is the opposite of science?\n\nAs I found out, there is no direct opposite of science. That's interesting. Sometimes, you can define something by knowing what it is not. You might think this is not so problematic. Take a few minutes to ask yourself: \"What is the opposite of science?\" Okay, good to have your focus back on the page. Maybe you thought science was cold and rational. I will share my personal story with science. For me, science was Star Trek: Enterprise. But I'm too young for Kirk and Spock. So, I was socialized with Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). That's where I first encountered Shakespeare, but that's another story. In TNG, science was determined by the exploration of new worlds. I would sit comfortably on the open bridge in front of the gigantic viewscreen. Commander Data was the embodiment of science. He was an android. He was rational and cold, devoid of emotion and humor. Let's flip these attributes.\n\nIf an android is science, then what is a human? Then is the human the opposite of science? Perhaps there is some truth to that. Humans have lived on this planet for thousands of years, but science as we know it began during the Enlightenment. So perhaps humans are the opposite of science. Human beings are full of emotions and feelings. Each one is very subjective and interested in their own development. They feel love and romance. Neither of these is very scientific. Humans also believe. Some believe in a more structured manner, like in big churches, while others believe in a more individual manner. However, believing in something has nothing to do with science. But humans do science. Therefore, science is part of humanity. As Joshua Schimel said, \"Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears. Our emotions are crucial to its development, and it cannot be truly understood as some bloodless, emotionless enterprise.\"@schimel2012writing Science is a human endeavor.  \n\nAccording to Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"@clarke1968clarke Is magic therefore the opposite of science? We cannot perform magic. We do not have the power to do so. However, some humans believe that we can perform magic. Who is \"we\"? The advanced part of humankind. We come into contact with our brothers and sisters who are at a different technological level, such as tribal cultures on isolated islands in Indonesia. To a tribe with a primitive culture, our technology seems like magic. Here, we can observe the cargo cult. A cargo cult is named after its appearance in World War II. The US Army faced the challenge of determining the best island-hopping route to mainland Japan. Since no one knew and the tides of war were constantly changing, the US Army Logistics Corps decided to drop cargo everywhere. This way, if US soldiers approached an island, there would already be plenty of supplies. \n\nWhat happened to the indigenous population? They believed that the gods had come to bring them cargo. They could not think of any other explanation for what they observed. They observed hardened silver birds dropping and landing on the islands. After a while, the gods stopped showing up. The war was over. But nobody told them. Therefore, the people of the islands copied the gods' behavior. They built the control room, and they made a radar station out of grass and wood. They even built plans out of grass. Nothing could work. They did everything perfectly, but they missed the point entirely. It was a cargo cult, not science. They copied someone else's routine and hoped to experience what the gods experienced when they did the same.\n\nDo you follow a cargo cult in your daily routines? Do you do things that you have seen but don't understand? Do you believe that they will work even though you don't know why? This is totally human and from my point of view totally necessary to be a working community member. Some stuff must be done, even if I don not really understand the why. But what if we do it in science? Then we will do cargo cult science @feynman1998cargo. It is a danger of enormous proportions if done in the wrong place with the wrong intentions. Still, most intentions are good and are twisted by the circumstances. There are several examples of following dogmatic rules and getting a catastrophic outcome. Later, we will explore different models of reality, including the Fukushima nuclear accident. \n\nFor now, I would like to conclude that the opposite of science is difficult to grasp. On the one hand, we could argue that human emotions and feelings are the opposite of cold, rational science. However, emotions are also the driving force behind human scientific inquiry. Therefore, we are doing something scientific by leaving the topic open for further research and looking for things that are not science.\n\n## What is not science?\n\nBesides things that are the opposite of science, there are things that are similar to science or that use attributes and tools in a distorted way to imitate science. Conspiracy theories [@douglas2023conspiracy; @grimes2016viability] look like science and use science terms and tools. They play on a stage that looks like science but has no deeper foundation. It's more like a nice story about humans harming other humans. However, conspiracy theories attempt to explain the world and often generate money for the storyteller. Therefore, I do not see conspiracy theories as the opposite of science. These conspiracy theories are non-science. Some theories have a historical basis, such as the hollow earth conspiracy theory. We will discuss the origin later. Conspiracy theories like to be retold, and in the process, they grow and multiply. To circumvent the proliferation of conspiracy theories, I will provide an illustration of the anti-conspiracy theory \"Birds Aren't Real\" by Peter McIndoe. \n\nWhat does the movement claim? In short, the US government kills all birds in the US and replaces them with bird-looking drones. Birds sit on power lines to recharge and defecate on cars to mark them visually. The bird drones are there to spy on American citizens. The specifications are inconsistent and vary. This is a typical sign of a conspiracy theory. Finally, U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the government due to his reluctance to kill all the birds as cherry on top.\n\n\nHere, we will not focus on conspiracy theories and how they work. That topic is beyond the scope of this book.\n\n\nWhat do conspiracy theories have in common? They all tell a good story. Personally, I find them more like fairy tales, with the standard Greek dramatic structure of one hero against an anonymous horde of evil.\n\nThey all have a lack of experiment. They do not even do a tiny experiment or state a hypothesis to test. \n\nPsychoanalysis have no experiments.\n\n\n## What is science?\n\nWe divide science into two parts. The natural sciences, which include beside others physics, chemistry and biology. With biology we include all the life sciences. The other part is the formal science. We see here the formal science as tools to do science. This is one way to distinguish fields of science. As formal science we have as the main fields the mathematics, logic and theoretical computer science. \n\n\n\n\n## Why do science?\n\nTo find a good explanation\n\nTo help people\n\nTo reduce suffering and pain\n\nTo make the plant earth more habitable \n\nTo live longer\n\nBecause the human is lazy@price2021laziness\n\n\n\n\n## How to do science?\n\n\"As a scientist, you are a professional writer,\" Joshua Schimel said. @schimel2012writing\n\nPauli defined the scientific method as \"taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.\" @fischer2022stunde. This is more or less about taking a chair and sitting in the middle of the room and getting bored as long as possible. Doing so sparks creativity.\n\nOtto Kruse stated in his book, \"many scientific topics can only be solved once all aspects have been explicitly formulated. The mind is not sufficiently prepared for this, as it can only ever focus on small sections at a time. Systematic thinking is only possible when writing, i.e. recording the results of one's thinking and relating them to other aspects.\"@kruse2007keine\n\nThe two paths of logic.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The difference between the two logical pathways: On the left is the inductive logic, which is a bottom-up approach that goes from specific to general. First, we observe and collect data, then we look for patterns in the data. Then, we draw a general conclusion about the pattern. After observing something a few times, we conclude that it is probably a rule. On the right is the deductive logic, a top-down approach from general to specific. We have a general theory and conduct an experiment to test it. Then, we draw a conclusion. From a more common perspective, the two logical pathways have things in common but differ in their train of thought.](chapter-01-what-is-science_files/figure-html/fig-sience-inductive-1.png){#fig-sience-inductive fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nErst Mach and observational things.\n\nKarl Pearson what is reality.\n\nQuantum mechanics, we do not know what reality is.\n\nThe measurement paradox. When there is no agent wo is measuring, does atoms exist? What does measuring mean? A interaction between a large and a small atomic object. Where is the border between large and quantum objects?\n\n## What is statistics in science?\n\nOn a warm spring day, I was sitting in my first statistics lecture. I don't remember everything, but one quote from the beginning of the lecture has stuck with me:  \"Statistics is the engine room of science.\" I think this quote might not have been spoken in this form. Rather, it was the underlying theme of the lecture.\n\nA toolbox of mathematical models to do science.\n\nIn this book we will use Fisherian statistics, which is inductive logic reasoning. Or in other words the logic of inductive inference.\n\nFisher switched from a mathematical deductive reasoning to a inductive reasoning in science. This is remarkable for me, because he changed the way he does science.\n\nStatistics by Fisher and quantum mechanics have in common that both do inductive probabilistic reasoning. Scientific models are deductive\n\nStatistical models are inductive\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Inductive reasoning is a probabilistic process in statistics. First, a hypothesis is stated. Then, an experiment is conducted based on the hypothesis, and data is collected. This data is a random representation of observables. This is where the probabilistic process begins. Then, statistical modeling is applied to the experimental data to minimize noise. Finally, a conclusion is drawn. Sometimes the aim is to make a probabilistic decision or explanation, with or without prediction.](chapter-01-what-is-science_files/figure-html/fig-statistic-inductive-1.png){#fig-statistic-inductive fig-align='center' width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInductive reasoning seems a bit difficult to follow. Therefore, I conducted a small experiment to derive the formula for an object's genetic energy, focusing on velocity. To make things easier, we will keep the mass constant. The formula is well-known; Newton discovered it. The formula for kinetic energy is $E_{kinetic} = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$. Therefore, we will take the mass of an object in kilograms and multiply it by the square of the velocity. Velocity is defined as follows: $v = \\tfrac{d}{t}$. We divide the distance traveled by the time it takes the object to travel that distance. Now, I want to find the dependency between velocity and kinetic energy. To do so, I built the following apparatus. A $30$-gram ($0.03kg$) ball lies on a height-adjustable tower. The ball will travel a ramp without friction, covering a distance of $60cm$ ($0.6m$) to the ground. At different heights, we will measure how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. Then, we can calculate the velocity in each trial. We know the ball's energy at the top. At the top, we find the potential energy with $E_{potential} = mgh$. We will multiply the ball's mass by the acceleration due to gravity, which is $9.81 m/s^2$, and the height of the tower. Since we are changing the height, the ball's energy will also increase.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The formula for kinetic energy can be derived through the following example experiment. A ball of fixed mass rolls down a fixed ramp from different heights. For each trial, the time it takes the ball to reach the bottom is measured with a stopwatch. The velocity can be calculated from the traveled distance and time. As the height increases, the ball will reach the ground in less time. Friction can be ignored. However, a measurement error will most likely occur in each trial.](chapter-01-what-is-science_files/figure-html/fig-newton-example-1.png){#fig-newton-example fig-align='center' width=552}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's write everything down. We have the mass of the ball, $m = 0.03kg$, the length of the ramp, $d = 2m$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g = 9.81 m/s^2$. We put the tower at five different heights and let the ball roll. The ball runs surprisingly fast. Because we cannot perfectly adjust the height, and manual time measurement is error-prone, we obtain noisy velocity measurements. The observed data has an error. The table @tbl-newton-data includes the measured and calculated data.\n\n| Height \\[m\\] | Potential energy \\[J\\] | Time \\[s\\] | Velocity \\[m/s\\] |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| $0.1$ | $0.1 \\cdot 0.03 \\cdot 9.81 = 0.029$ | $1.58$ | $2/1.58 = 1.27$ |\n| $0.2$ | $0.059$ | $0.95$ | $2.11$ |\n| $0.3$ | $0.088$ | $0.85$ | $2.36$ |\n| $0.4$ | $0.118$ | $0.65$ | $3.09$ |\n| $0.5$ | $0.147$ | $0.72$ | $2.78$ |\n\n: Results table from the experiment to determine the formula for kinetic energy. The height was changed five times. Using the acceleration due to gravity, the potential energy of the ball can be determined from its height and fixed weight. The ball's speed can be determined from the rolling time and the fixed ramp length. {#tbl-newton-data}\n\nA table of data is nice, but most of us cannot really see anything in a table. Therefore, we will visualize our data throughout the book. The @fig-kenetic-energy displays the five data points for the energy of the balls and the final velocity. The blue line shows the result of a statistical model. I ran a nonlinear regression to find the perfect line through the points. How did I do this? We will discuss modeling later in the book. In contrast, the purple line shows the actual dependency of velocity on energy. There is a deviation in our statistical model. We can visualize this deviation as an area of uncertainty in our plot. Due to this deviation, we cannot find the perfect formula. There are different ways to show statistical deviation. In general, the deviation is related to how far the individual observations or points are from the line drawn by the model. This process is called fitting a line through points.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visualization of the relationship between energy and velocity. The points represent calculated velocities from different heights. Due to measurement errors, the points do not fit perfectly on a line.

No matter what we do, there will always be an error, noise, or deviation. There are different names for nearly identical concepts. This is the core of inductive reasoning using statistics. We will always have errors, and we want to minimize them. The main topic of this book is what this error is and how we describe these errors. Not really the errors themselves, but rather the concept of drawing lines through points by minimizing error.\n\nRandomization and random observations\n\n## What is a good explanation?\n\n## What is real?\n\n\nSometimes we need a model to know what is real.\n\nFukusima @sevon2020analysis @sevon2023analyzing\n\n\n## Age of enlightment\n\nRomantic as the answer to enlightment.\n\n## General background\n\nFull quote\n\n> *\"Reality is negotiable.
