January 2026 at 20:15:49*\n\n> *\"Reality is negotiable.\" --- Tim Ferriss*\n\nThe first chapter of this book is already the hardest. I started writing this chapter very early on, perhaps even before any of the others. Yet it took the longest to finish. The question is simple: What is science? The more I researched, the more complicated the answer became. Or the other way around. I followed the advice of Wolfgang Pauli. Pauli defined the scientific method as \"taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.\" Therefore, I tried to read and find answers to the question of what science might be. Perhaps science is, at its core, something personal. However, science also has objective aspects that I want to present here. Ultimately, decide for yourself what science truly is.\n\nThe following @fig-overview-sience-non-science shows the demarcation line between science and non-science. In the next sections, we will discuss each specific part, but I think it's important to start with a clear overview. Science is distinguished from non-science through experimentation and falsification. This is true in this book. There are many subtle definitions, but I will keep it simple here. If an experiment is not possible, then it is not science. We also need the ability to build a falsification framework. Therefore, we need hypotheses that can be rejected by experimentation. These two requirements are met by the natural sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology, in order of their purity. Biology includes medicine and all other fields of knowledge gathered from living things. In addition to natural science, there is formal science, which can be seen as a tool of science. This is due to the lack of experimentation, falsification, or both. Therefore, we will not include mathematics, logic, or theoretical computer science as sciences. True non-science fields are intuition-based or subjective at their core. There are many of these fields, and we will discuss them shortly. The humanities are undoubtedly different from non-science, but this book is not about the humanities, so we will put them aside.        \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visualization of the demarcation line of science. This line divides science from non-science through experimentation and the principle of falsification. The purity of science fields is taken from xkcd comic #435 ([https://xkcd.com/435](https://xkcd.com/435/)). According to this definition, natural science, including physics, chemistry, and biology, is separated from formal science, including mathematics. Formal science must be clearly distinguished from other intuition-based and subjective non-science, such as pseudoscience or anti-science. The humanities are indisputably different but are also considered non-science in this schematic.](chapter-01-what-is-science_files/figure-html/fig-overview-sience-non-science-1.png){#fig-overview-sience-non-science fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPerhaps we should start with the supposedly easy part. What is the opposite of science? In doing so, we will gain an understanding of the term \"science\" and what it means to us. This may be the deepest lesson for me: we cannot really grasp science. Science is connected to each person in a different emotional way. Science seems cold and rational, but humans are not. Therefore, our relationship with science is strange and complex.\n\n## What is the opposite of science?\n\nAs I found out, there is no direct opposite of science. That's interesting. Sometimes, you can define something by knowing what it is not. You might think this is not so problematic. Take a few minutes to ask yourself: \"What is the opposite of science?\" Okay, good to have your focus back on the page. Maybe you thought science was cold and rational. I will share my personal story with science. For me, science was Star Trek: Enterprise. But I'm too young for Kirk and Spock. So, I was socialized with Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). That's where I first encountered Shakespeare, but that's another story. In TNG, science was determined by the exploration of new worlds. I would sit comfortably on the open bridge in front of the gigantic viewscreen. Commander Data was the embodiment of science. He was an android. He was rational and cold, devoid of emotion and humor. Let's flip these attributes.\n\nIf an android is science, then what is a human? Then is the human the opposite of science? Perhaps there is some truth to that. Humans have lived on this planet for thousands of years, but science as we know it began during the Enlightenment. So perhaps humans are the opposite of science. Human beings are full of emotions and feelings. Each one is very subjective and interested in their own development. They feel love and romance. Neither of these is very scientific. Humans also believe. Some believe in a more structured manner, like in big churches, while others believe in a more individual manner. However, believing in something has nothing to do with science. But humans do science. Therefore, science is part of humanity. As Joshua Schimel said, \"Knowledge is a product of human hopes and fears. Our emotions are crucial to its development, and it cannot be truly understood as some bloodless, emotionless enterprise.\"@schimel2012writing Science is a human endeavor.  \n\nAccording to Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"@clarke1968clarke Is magic therefore the opposite of science? We cannot perform magic. We do not have the power to do so. However, some humans believe that we can perform magic. Who is \"we\"? The advanced part of humankind. We come into contact with our brothers and sisters who are at a different technological level, such as tribal cultures on isolated islands in Indonesia. To a tribe with a primitive culture, our technology seems like magic. Here, we can observe the cargo cult. A cargo cult is named after its appearance in World War II. The US Army faced the challenge of determining the best island-hopping route to mainland Japan. Since no one knew and the tides of war were constantly changing, the US Army Logistics Corps decided to drop cargo everywhere. This way, if US soldiers approached an island, there would already be plenty of supplies. \n\nWhat happened to the indigenous population? They believed that the gods had come to bring them cargo. They could not think of any other explanation for what they observed. They observed hardened silver birds dropping and landing on the islands. After a while, the gods stopped showing up. The war was over. But nobody told them. Therefore, the people of the islands copied the gods' behavior. They built the control room, and they made a radar station out of grass and wood. They even built plans out of grass. Nothing could work. They did everything perfectly, but they missed the point entirely. It was a cargo cult, not science. They copied someone else's routine and hoped to experience what the gods experienced when they did the same.\n\nDo you follow a cargo cult in your daily routines? Do you do things that you have seen but don't understand? Do you believe that they will work even though you don't know why? This is totally human and from my point of view totally necessary to be a working community member. Some stuff must be done, even if I don not really understand the why. But what if we do it in science? Then we will do cargo cult science @feynman1998cargo. It is a danger of enormous proportions if done in the wrong place with the wrong intentions. Still, most intentions are good and are twisted by the circumstances.\n\natomic chamber fukushima\n\n\nCargo cult science\n\nconspiracy theories @douglas2023conspiracy and @grimes2016viability\n\n\n\n## What is not science?\n\nMathematics and psychoanalysis have no experiments.\n\nMathematics and logic are more like scientific tools to do science.\n\nRomantic as the answer to enlightment.\n\n\n## Why do science?\n\n\n\n## How to do science?\n\n\"As a scientist, you are a professional writer,\" Joshua Schimel said. @schimel2012writing\n\nPauli defined the scientific method as \"taking up a subject repeatedly. Thinking about it. Setting it aside. Gathering new empirical material. And continuing this process for years if necessary. In this way, the conscious mind stimulates the unconscious mind. If anything, this is the only way to achieve results.\" @fischer2022stunde. This is more or less about taking a chair and sitting in the middle of the room and getting bored as long as possible. Doing so sparks creativity.\n\n> *\"Many scientific topics can only be solved once all aspects have been explicitly formulated. The mind is not sufficiently prepared for this, as it can only ever focus on small sections at a time. Systematic thinking is only possible when writing, i.e. recording the results of one's thinking and relating them to other aspects.\" --- Otto Kruse @kruse2007keine*\n\n## What is statistics?\n\nA toolbox of mathematical models to do science.\n\nIn this book we will use Fisherian statistics, which is inductive logic reasoning. Or in other words the logic of inductive inference.\n\nFisher switched from a mathematical deductive reasoning to a inductive reasoning in science. This is remarkable for me, because he changed the way he does science.\n\nStatistics by Fisher and quantum mechanics have in common that both do inductive probabilistic reasoning. Scientific models are deductive\n\nStatistical models are inductive\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The difference between the two logical pathways: On the left is the inductive logic, which is a bottom-up approach that goes from specific to general. First, we observe and collect data, then we look for patterns in the data. Then, we draw a general conclusion about the pattern. After observing something a few times, we conclude that it is probably a rule. On the right is the deductive logic, a top-down approach from general to specific. We have a general theory and conduct an experiment to test it. Then, we draw a conclusion. From a more common perspective, the two logical pathways have things in common but differ in their train of thought.](chapter-01-what-is-science_files/figure-html/fig-sience-inductive-1.png){#fig-sience-inductive fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Inductive reasoning is a probabilistic process in statistics.

This is where the probabilistic process begins. Then, statistical modeling is applied to the experimental data to minimize noise. Finally, a conclusion is drawn.
