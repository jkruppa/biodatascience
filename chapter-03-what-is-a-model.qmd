## General background


| Application | Symbol | Name | Description |
|:-------------|:--------:|:------------------|:------------------|
|  | $y$ | **outcome**, response, endpoint, dependent variable | *The right-hand side (abbr. RHS) of the model. Describing the values measured in an experiment or study.* |
|  | $x$ | **influencer**, influential variable, risk factor, fixed effect, independent variable | *The left-hand side (abbr. LHS) of the model. Describing the influential  variables in an experiment or study.* |
|  | $z$ | **random effect** | *A factor that provides a description of an grouping variable, which is not part of the controlled experimental setting.* |
| Explanation | $x$ | **explanator**, explanatory variable | *The influencer is used to describe or explain the outcome.* |
| Prediction | $x$ | **predictor**, predictive variable | *The influencer is used to predict the outcome.* |
| Main effect | $x$ | **focal explanator**, **focal predictor**, focal variable | *In a model with multiple influencers, the focal variable is the variable of primary interest.* |
| Continuous $x$ | $c$ | **covariate**, covariable | *The influencer is a numeric variable with continuous values.* |
| Categorical $x$ | $f_A$ | **factor A**, factorial variable, categorical variable | *The influencer is discrete, functioning as a grouping variable, such as an experimental group or a treatment.*  |
| Factor $f_A$ | $A.1$ to $A.j$ | **levels**, groups, treatment groups | *The discrete groups included in one factor A.*  |
