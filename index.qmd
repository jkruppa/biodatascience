# Preface {.unnumbered}

> *"Life is difficult." --- M. Scott Peck's, The Road Less Traveled *

It's too early to write a preface. I started writing this book a few weeks ago. From my perspective, it will be a good one, but it will take some time. In the meantime, you are welcome to see what's happening here and what I'm writing. Sometimes things will be in the wrong place. This is a normal part of the writing process. Just so you know, I started writing on 15 November 2025.

> *This book has a German predecessor. You might not recognise this book. That's fine. The page can be found at the following link: <https://jkruppa.github.io/>. However, it is much more unstructured. It is more like a cookbook than this book, which has a continuous storyline.*
