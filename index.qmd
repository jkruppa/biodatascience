Light. She can't see anything. Her eyes must adapt to the brightness first. She is alone in the light. The light travels in a straight line through floating points in the air. Squares of light are slowly turning and dancing. Trying to find the optimal position and size. The stage is set. She takes a step. Then another. She feels the creak of the moist wooden stage. She turns her head into the ranks where the seats must be. Her voice was crystal clear in the cold air. *"I don't think this will work, Jeff! The whole stage is rotten. There's no structure behind it."* Darkness again. She feels alone in the dark. Jeff's voice comes from below. *"First, we must fix the stage, and then we can continue."* Janine was an actress, not a craftsman. *"Okay, I'll go along with it. But first, I need to understand the stage and how everything works."* A long pause of silence. *"The reality of the play,"* Jeff grumbles. It will be a long day before they can even think about starting the play.

This will be a long journey... it's a hell of a time.

I need to see it. Therefore, this book is a visualization whenever it is possible or feasible. Some more complex models will be described rather than visualized.

There are better mathematical or theoretical books. I would recommend the book by Westfall and Arias (2020)@westfall2020understanding. It is an enjoyable read and provides a wealth of information on regression models. The visuals are mediocre at best. The R code is outdated and not state of the art for the 21st century.

Some ideas are not new. I will present them in a different way. I think this is an effective approach to writing a book. The book aims to teach you and enable you to teach statistics to beginners. It may also be beneficial for more advanced classes, but my emphasis was always on the uninformed learners.

Lying to children or some angels will be hurt. Sometimes math is a shield to hide behind. Not really the math itself but the mathematical notations. If you cant speak the math language you cannot follow the train of thought. Because communication the the search for compliance, misunderstanding a language can be barrier. 

Machine room of science

Bloody beginners and the curse of knowledge

Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics. Perhaps it will be wise to approach the subject cautiously." --- Opening lines of 'States of Matter', by D.L. Goodstein.*
