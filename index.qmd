# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This cookbook contains an extensive collection of recipes from the fields of biostatistics, biometrics, statistics, bioinformatics and R programming. These will enable you to gain in-depth knowledge of these subject areas for data analysis, eliminating the need to attend my courses. Feel free to browse through the book to see if anything interests you, and then put together your own menu. I am continuously updating the book and adding to it all the time. In addition to the written content, there are also explanatory YouTube videos available. Either way, I am delighted that you are interested in learning something new, whether through personal interest or exam preparation. Either way, I recommend that you just take a look around. Don't be put off by the sheer volume of material â€“ it just happened that way.

> *An German version of this Openbook Bio Data Science is available. The page exists at link <https://jkruppa.github.io/>, but is much more unstructured.  It is more like a cookbook in contrast to this book with a continous storyline.*
